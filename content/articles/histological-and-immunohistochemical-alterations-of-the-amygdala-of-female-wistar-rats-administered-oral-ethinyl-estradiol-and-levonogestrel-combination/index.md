Combined oral contraceptive pills containing two synthetic hormones, Ethinyl estradiol and Progestin
were evaluated in this study. Mood and brain structure changes in individuals on combined oral
contraceptives are inconsistent, warranting the histological and immunohistochemical studies of the
Amygdala of female Wistar rats administered oral Ethinyl estradiol and Levonogestrel combination.
Thirty-two female Wistar rats weighing between 180g and 200g were equally divided into four groups
(1-4). Control and groups administered 0.002mg/kg Levonogestrel plus 0.00043mg/kg Ethinyl
estradiol for 21, 42 and 63 days. Twenty-four hours after the last administrations, the rats were
anaesthetized and the brains perfusion-fixed transcardially with 10% buffered Formalin. The whole
brain was excised and fixed in 10% buffered Formalin for 48 h. The Amygdala was dissected,
processed for paraffin sectioning, stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and immunolabelled with
anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein. Histological results of the Amygdala showed hypertrophied nuclei
in the test groups, especially in the 63 days Levonogestrel plus Ethinyl estradiol group. These test
groups also showed GFAP positive cells, whose expression was increased in the 21 and 42 days
Levonogestrel plus Ethinyl estradiol groups, except in the 63 days Levonogestrel plus Ethinyl estradiol
group which decreased compared with the control. In conclusion combined oral Ethinyl estradiol plus
Levonogestrel induced cellular alteration and reactive Astrocytes in the Amygdala, except in the 63
days Levonogestrel plus Ethinyl estradiol group which was decreased implying stress due to chronic
exposure.

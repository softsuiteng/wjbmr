Temperature and postural stress are known to affect cardiovascular indices such as heart rate and
blood pressure. However, males and females may respond differently during pathological states. Of
importance is the magnitude of this variation amongst otherwise healthy young individuals across
various regions globally. The cold pressor test (CPT) can be used clinically to evaluate autonomic and
left ventricular function. It is also used to assess neural control of the cardiovascular system by
observing the pressor response during the immersion of one hand in cold water. This study examined
the gender differences in cardiovascular responses to cold pressor test and postural stress among
young healthy adult Nigerians (20 males and 20 females). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic
blood pressure (DBP) and Heart rate (HR) were measured and recorded before and after either
postural change or CPT. The results of this study showed significant gender differences in measured
cardiovascular indices response following postural change and CPT. Female DBP and HR responses
(difference between pre- and post- measurements) to postural change were significantly higher than
males. Thus, females tend to elicit higher autonomic responses to postural change especially in HR
(sympathetic tachycardia) and DBP(a function of peripheral resistance) than males.

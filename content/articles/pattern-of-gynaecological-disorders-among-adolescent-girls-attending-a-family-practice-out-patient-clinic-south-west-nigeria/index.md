Adolescence is the period of life between 10-19 years. They constitute about 19% of the total world population, yet remain a largely neglected, difficult-to-measure, and hard-to-reach population with their needs often being ignored. Gynaecological problems in adolescents may significantly contribute to their overall maturation and psychological remodeling as they transit from childhood to womanhood. The objective of this study was to study the types and prevalence of gynaecological disorders among adolescent girls attending the General Outpatient Gynaecological Clinic, Sacred Heart Hospital (SHH), Lantoro, Abeokuta. Between January 2006 and December 2010, adolescent girls who had attained menarche were consecutively recruited into the study. Data was collected by personal interviews using a pre-tested, semi structured questionnaire. Focused laboratory and physical examination results were recorded for each subject. Out of a total of 32,671 gynaecological consultations, 401 (1.2%) were adolescents aged 10-19 years. Majority of them, 215 (53.6%) were between 16 and 19 years of age. Two hundred and eighteen (54.4%) presented with menstrual disorders while the rest, 183 (45.6%) had non-menstrual conditions. Menstrual disorders included dysmenorrhea (46.8%), amenorrhoea (12.4%), dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) 19.7%, oligomenorrhoea (4.1%), hypomenorrhoea (3.2%), irregular cycles (9.6%), menorrhagia (2.7%) and metrorrhagia (1.4%). Out of those with menstrual disorders, 114 (28.4%) had body mass index (BMI) greater than 25kg/m,while the rest had a BMI of less than 25kg/mLogistic regression demonstrated that BMI greater than 25kg/m significantly increased the risk of having dysmenorrhoea, DUB and amenorrhoea; Odds Ratio (OR) 2.57(95% CI, 1.069-6.238), 8.75(95% CI, 1.420-69.095) and 16.00 (95% CI, 1.350-431.992) respectively. Gynaecological problems including menstrual disorders are common among adolescents presenting in the outpatient clinic of a typical family practice hospital. Some forms of menstrual disorders are commoner among those who are overweight. We suggest that, as an integral part of adolescent reproductive health care services, adolescents who are overweight should be counseled for diet regime and exercise plan that could promote weight loss.

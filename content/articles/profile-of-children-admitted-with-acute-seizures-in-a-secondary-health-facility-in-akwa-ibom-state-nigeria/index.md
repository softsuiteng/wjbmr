Acute seizure is a common indication for hospital admissions in children. It may be associated with
significant morbidity and mortality. To determine the common aetiologies and outcome of acute seizures among children admitted into Paediatric Unit of General Hospital, Iquita, Oron in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. This was a hospital-based prospective study which was conducted over a period of two st st years from 1 August, 2018 to 31 July, 2020. Children aged 1month to 16 years with seizures presenting to the Paediatric Unit of the General hospital Iquita, Oron were consecutively recruited into the study. Data obtained included their demographics, clinical presentations, underlying diagnosis,duration of hospitalisation and outcome. Acute seizures occurred among 52 patients out of the 986
patients admitted over the period giving a prevalence rate of 5.27%. Forty out of 52 patients (76.9%) had malaria. Other illnesses associated with acute seizures included bacterial meningitis (n=3) and sepsis (n=3). About 31% had received herbal or plain water enema before presentation. Mortality rate was 11.5% with severe malaria and sepsis as the commonest causes of mortality. Acute seizures are relatively common among children living in a malaria endemic coastal city of Oron, Akwa Ibom State. The most common causes are potentially preventable. Though the outcome was good in the majority ofpatients, government should enforce available programmes for these preventable illnesses and mothers should be educated on home management of acute seizures.

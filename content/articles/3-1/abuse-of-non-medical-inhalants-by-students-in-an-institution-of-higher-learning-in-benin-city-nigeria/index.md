The abuse of inhalants is generally not regarded as a challenge in our environmentdespite their ready availability, accessibility and deleterious effect on multiple organs and even on the unborn baby. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence rates of inhalants use, types of inhalants used and age at first use of inhalants and to find out whether there was any association between year of study, age, sex and abuse of inhalants. Atotal of 400 questionnaires were administered across the five schools of College of Education; 80 in each school. Second year students were selected purposively from each school except the School of Language where first year students were selected. This was to enable comparison between fresh students and students who are mid way in their educational experience in the school. Departments were selected via convenience sampling method. Twenty seven point zero four percent of the respondents were males, while 72.96% were females; 89.29% and 10.71% were 18-28 years and 29-39 years respectively, while 97.96%, 1.02% and 1.02% were Christians, Muslims and African traditional religion practitioners respectively. Nineteen point st nd six four percent were in 1st year while 80.36% were in 2nd year. Lifetime prevalence of inhalants use was 2.6%, prevalence for past year was 1.3% while that of current use was 0.8%. Forty percent of those who have ever used inhalants used premium motor spirit; 30% inhaled fumes of heated oil and the remaining 30% inhaled spray. Fifty percent of the participants who have ever use inhalants first did so within 13 to 14 years, 30% first did so at 10 year old or less while 20% first abused inhalants within 17 to 19 years. Being a female was significantly associated with lifetime use of inhalant while age or year of study was not. Seventy percent of abusers combined inhalants with other substances while 30% used inhalants alone. The abuse of inhalants deserves attention. It should be integrated into efforts aimed at preventing and controlling the use of psychoactive substances.

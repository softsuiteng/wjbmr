ABSTRACT
The phytochemical screening of Ocimumgratissimum(OG) and Gongronemalatifolium(GL) leaves and their effects on blood parameters of streptozotocin (65mg/kg b.w,)-induced diabetic rats of Wistar strain were studied. Thirty-six male albino Wistarrats were randomised into 6 groups. Each group comprised of 6 rats. Groups Aand Fwere treated with distilled water to respectively serve as diabetic and normal controls, while the diabetic-induced rats in Groups B, C, D and E were respectively treated orally with extracts of GL (200mg/kg body weight), OG (200mg/kg body weight), combined extracts of OG and GL (OGGL:100mg/kg body weight each) and subcutaneous 5 IU/kg body weight of insulin. The animals were treated for 28 days after which they were sacrificed forwhole bloodcollection that was used for haematological assays. The results of phytochemical analysis of the two leaf-extracts demonstratedthe presence of various levels of alkaloids, tannins, phlobatannins, flavonoids, polyphenols, saponins, and reducing sugars. Haematological analysis of the rats demonstrated significant (p<0.05) decreases in of red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (HB), mean cell volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemolobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and platelet count (PLT) in diabeticcontrol rats that were neither treated with the extracts nor insulin compared to the normal control and diabetics rats treated with the extracts or insulin. Total white blood cell counts, percentage lymphocytes and mean platelet volume were on the other hand significantly increased in this group of rats. The combined extracts treated rats showed significant decrease in haematological parameters when compared to single extracts treatments, hence revealing a negative synergistic interaction of the two leaves extracts.

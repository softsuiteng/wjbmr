Contraception offers several lofty benefits to the family. As an important health concept that affects family
dynamics in all its ramification, contraceptive practice, especially among married women, is influenced by
several factors. The objective of the study was to determine the influence of family members and social network
on contraceptive decision among married women attending the family planning clinic of the University of Uyo
Teaching Hospital (UUTH), Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study
involving 165 married women aged 15-49 years who attended the family planning clinic of UUTH, Uyo,
between May and September, 2013, recruited through simple random sampling technique. Apre-tested semistructured interviewer administered questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-demographic
characteristics of the respondents and the influence of family members and social network on contraceptive
practice among the married women. The data obtained were analysed using the statistical package for social
sciences (SPSS). The mean age of the subjects were 32.22 (Â±5.56). The results obtained showed that the
decision to use contraceptives were significantly influenced by mothers-in-law (P=0.017), mothers (P=0.027),
sisters (P=0.008) and friends (P=0.042). Intra-uterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD) was the most preferred
method of contraception (38.20%). Due to the influence of family members on contraceptive decisions of
married women, it is recommended that contraceptive information, education and counseling should not be
restricted to the married women alone but also to close family members so as to ensure their involvement and
success of such contraceptive practice.

Shift work which is mainly characterized with sleep disruption has been reported to alter behavioral alertness,
cognition, emotion, attention and general systemic functions. However, it is not known whether sleep
deprivation in shift work would alter pain perception. The current study was designed to investigate the effect of
shift work on pain perception in healthy Nigeria human and to possibly know if the effect is â-Endorphin
dependent. Sixty healthy volunteers were randomly selected from Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria (consisting of 30
shift workers from MTN Telecommunication Company and 30 non-shift workers from the members of the
public). These individuals were recruited, trained on what they should expect during the study and informed
consent was obtained. Questionnaires were administered to gather volunteers' biodata and socio-demographic
background. Cold, ischemia and cold+ischemia-induced pain was administered, and the pain threshold and
tolerance were estimated. Our results show that shift work significantly decreases (p<0.05) the pain threshold
and tolerance during ischemia-induced pain test, and causes a significant increase (p<0.05) in pain tolerance
during cold-induced and cold+ischemia-induced pain tests. Also, the circulating plasma â-Endorphin
decreased (p<0.05) with shift work during cold-induced and cold+ischemia-induced pain tests when compared
with non shift work. The results demonstrate that shift work alters pain perception which is accompanied by
alteration in circulating level of plasma â-Endorphin.

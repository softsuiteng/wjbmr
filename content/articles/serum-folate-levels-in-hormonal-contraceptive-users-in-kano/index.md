Hormonal contraceptives (HCPs) are the major class of prescription drugs, used by a large proportion of women starting from early adolescence. Folate is a vitamin with significant roles to play in cell division and amino acid metabolism, under its function in various coenzyme-dependent reactions.This study was aimed at evaluating serum folate level in HCP users and compare these levels to non-HCP users. Sixty healthy females of reproductive age on HCP's were recruited as the test group and 30 nonHCP users were recruited as the control group. The serum Folate levels of the subjects and the controls were determined by human Folate specific ELISA Kit. The results showed a significant decrease in mean serum Folate levels of subjects compared to controls with mean and standard deviation values of 2.3747 ± 1.62129ng/ml and 6.4200 ± 3.69803ng/ml respectively (p <0.001). Thus, based on the findings of the current study, HCP use is associated with a lowered serum Folate level. Therefore, it is recommended that women continue periodic Folate supplementation during HCP use.

Interhospital transport of very ill patient has continued to be a major shortcoming in our management of
patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital. Getting this process right
will go a long way in improving the quality of care rendered to this special group of patients. This study seeks to
assess how closely our present practice adhere to established guidelines and also highlights the problems
hindering efficient interhospital transport of critically ill patients in our institution. This was a retrospective
study of all critically ill patients transported from the ICU of University of Uyo Teaching Hospital between
January 2009 and April 2015. Patients' data were obtained from ICU records. Data included Sex, Age,
Diagnosis, Time interval between decision to transfer and actual transfer (Decision/Transport interval),
Reason for transfer, Accompanying personnel, Appropriateness of Equipment, Mode of transfer and Type of
vehicle. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data. Chi-square test was to determine significance between
variables. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. All data was analysed using IBM-SPSS 22.0.0.0.
Fifteen critically ill patients were transported within the study period. There were more males 12(80%) than
females 3(20%): a male to female ratio of 4:1. The age range was between 11-81 years with a mean of 51.1years.
Neurosurgical (Severe head injury and spinal cord injury) patients constituted a majority 7(46.7%) of those
transported. Ten (66.7) patients were transported for reason of lack of expertise. The decision/transport
interval ranged between 1-4 days. Aphysician/nurse, or physician/anaesthetic technician, team accompanied
patients only on 4(26.6%) occasions. A single technician was the accompanying personnel on 6(40.0%)
occasions. Equipment for the transport of patients was found to be appropriate in only 3(20.0%) cases. While
land transport (80%) was the dominant mode of transport, private cars were used to transport 7(46.7%) of the
patients. An ambulance was used only 4(26.7%) times for transport to the referral hospital. It is obvious from
this study that our practice is a far cry from the minimum acceptable standards from available guidelines.
There is a need for adherence to established protocols when transporting critically ill patienta to enhance
safety. There is an urgent need to establish a neurosurgical unit and a transport team with appropriate
equipment and protocols. Every aspect of the transport process must be looked into including documentation,
communication and the welfare of the transport team.

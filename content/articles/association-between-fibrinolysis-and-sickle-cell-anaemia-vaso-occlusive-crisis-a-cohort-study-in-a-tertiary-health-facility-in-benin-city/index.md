Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is associated with hypercoagulability. There is inconclusive evidence on the contribution of abnormal fibrinolytic activity to vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in SCA patients. The study aims to evaluate the association between SCA vaso-occlusive crisis and abnormal fibrinolysis using tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and to correlate their levels with some haematological parameters of the SCA patients. This is a cohort study. Thirty SCA subjects recruited from the adult haematology clinic of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital Benin City in steady-state were followed up to the onset of a vaso-occlusive crisis. Thirty HbAA subjects were recruited from the donor clinic as controls. The t-PA and PAI-1 levels were estimated using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays at recruitment and then following onset of VOC. Haematological parameters were determined with haematology auto-analyzer. Data were analyzed using SPSS 21. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. The median t-PA levels did not differ significantly between SCA VOC and steady-state (1.36 vs. 0.12ng/ml; p = 0.796). Similarly, median PAI-1 did not differ significantly between SCA VOC and steady-state (11.93 vs. 11.30ng/ml; p = 0.197). There was a negative correlation between t-PA and haematocrit during VOC (r = 0.922, p = 0.001).There was a negative correlation between t-PA and haematocrit during VOC (r = 0.922, p = 0.001).PAI-1 with white blood cell count and platelet countThere were no correlations between tPA, PAI-1, white blood cell counts and platelet counts (p>0.05). Vaso-occlusive crisis is not associated with abnormalities in fibrinolytic proteins in SCA patients. T-PA correlated negatively with haematocrit level in VOC state.

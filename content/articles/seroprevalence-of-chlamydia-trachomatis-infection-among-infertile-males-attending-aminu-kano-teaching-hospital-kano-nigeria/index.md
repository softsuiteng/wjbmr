Chlamydia trachomatis remains one of the most abundant infective bacteria that causes sexually transmitted
diseases globally. To determine the prevalence of C. trachomatis associated infertility in male patients
attending Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano. Urine specimens were received from 146 clients visiting the
Infertility clinics in Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH). Prior to specimen collection informed consent
was obtained and an inquiry form administered by the investigator. Specimens were tested using a Chlamydia
kit (Swalife China)-a rapid immunoassay test designed to identify genital chlamydial antigen in urogenital
specimens. 146 sequential urine specimens of patients (aged 22-55 years) were obtained. Eight of these
specimens were positive for C. trachomatis antigen yielding a prevalence of 5.4%. While 6 clients had some
knowledge of Chlamydia (4.1%), 140 clients had no knowledge of Chlamydia (95.8%). Those with primary
infertility were 124(84.9%) and those with secondary infertility were 22 (15.0%). Also prevalence in relation to
age grouping was as follows: 22-26 years (42.9%), 27-31years (9.4%), 32-36 years (10.5%), 37-41years (6.4%),
42-46 years (6.3%) and > 47 years (4.0%). In this study, the prevalence of C. trachomatis in infertile males was
found to be 5.4% with a low knowledge about infertility among participants. There is a need to increase
awareness and screening of the larger populace for carriage of C. trachomatis.

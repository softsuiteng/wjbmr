Pseudohyperkalaemia is a phenomenon characterized by spurious elevation of measured serum potassium
concentration without the patient having increased circulating potassium levels in the blood. It is a fairly
common laboratory artifact than can cause misleading diagnosis and inappropriate treatment of
hyperkalaemia. To highlight the likelihood of occurrence of pseudohyperkalaemia and hence the need for its
exclusion as a potential cause of laboratory error in the measurement of serum potassium concentration. We
report four suspected, investigated, and established cases of pseudohyperkalaemia due to: (1) use of wrong
specimen bottles, (2) improper specimen preservation, (3) in vitro sample haemolysis. In the four cases,
measured plasma potassium concentrations were markedly higher than the critical value for plasma potassium
concentration. However, repeat testing in each case revealed potassium levels within reference limits (3.5
5.1mmol/L) thereby confirming the diagnosis of pseudohyperkalaemia. Pseudohyperkalaemia is a fairly
common phenomenon in contemporary clinical practice. Its occurrence must be excluded before a definitive
diagnosis of (true) hyperkalaemia is made.

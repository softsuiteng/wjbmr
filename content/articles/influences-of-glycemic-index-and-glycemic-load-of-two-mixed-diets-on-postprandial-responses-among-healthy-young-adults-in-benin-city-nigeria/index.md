There is scarce literature on the glycemic indices and glycemic loads of most Nigerian foods. Diseases
and disorders associated with the consumption of carbohydrate foods are on the increase. This study
aimed to provide insights into the dietary management of metabolic disorders linked to carbohydrate
foods, such as diabetes mellitus, by providing glycemic index and glycemic load data on two commonly
consumed Nigerian foods using standard documented methods. Healthy volunteer subjects were
selected from among the undergraduate students of the Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Benin,
Benin City, to participate in the study. Glucose was served as the control food while Titus sardine with
bread and Titus sardine with Indomie noodles were the test foods. All the participants were subjected to
an overnight fast of at least 12 hours. The postprandial responses were measured with a standardized
glucometer. Hitherto, the proximate analyses of the foods were all determined by standard methods.
The results obtained indicated that the glycemic index and the glycemic load of the test foods were low:
23 and 47 for Titus sardine with bread, and Titus sardine with Indomie noodles respectively, indicating
that the mixed foods could be consumed by both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. Consumption
of single foods like white bread alone indicated a high glycemic index which is not healthy for diabetic
individuals. However, in view of the demonstrated lowering of glycaemic index, the mixed diets
evaluated in this study could be recommended for diabetic individuals.

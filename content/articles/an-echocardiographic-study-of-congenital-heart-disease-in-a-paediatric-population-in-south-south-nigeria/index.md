Congenital cardiac anomalies still remain the commonest type of birth defect seen in the general population worldwide and are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality especially in infancy and early childhood. Recent epidemiological data suggest a gradual increase in the prevalence of these anomalies.With echocardiography being the bedrock of diagnosis, it was the aim of this study to determine the echocardiographic pattern of Congenital Heart defects in children seen in University of Uyo Teaching Hospital. The study was a retrospective analysis of the echocardiography reports of children being investigated for cardiac disease over a five year period (January, 2008 to July, 2013) in the hospital. A total of 20,479 children were seen in the department over the study period. Seventy three of these patients were found to have cardiac anomalies with an almost equal M:F ratio of 1.02:1. Congenital cardiac anomalies accounted for 58(79.43%) of the subjects giving a prevalence rate of 3/1000 with Ventricular Septal defect (VSD) being the commonest congenital anomaly occurring in 32.9% of congenital heart diseases seen. With the attendant morbidity and mortality attributable to this disease condition, we recommend that a cardiac intervention program be put in place to help reduce the burden of disease in the paediatric population in our environment.

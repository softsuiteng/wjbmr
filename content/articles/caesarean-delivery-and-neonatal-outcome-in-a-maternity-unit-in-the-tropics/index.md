Caesarean section remains an alternative route of childbirth, and it is associated with a higher risk of maternal
morbidity and mortality, as well as potential impact on neonatal outcome. This study was conducted to evaluate
the practice of caesarean section in the study centre and to assess its impact especially on the surgical site and
neonatal outcome. A pro forma was specially designed to collect relevant information prospectively from
mothers who were delivered through caesarean section. The majority (75.2%) of the caesarean sections were
performed as emergency procedures by Senior Registrars. Major indications were intrapartum haemorrhage
(10.3%), obstructed labour (9.5%) and two previous caesarean sections (59.5%). The surgical site condition
was satisfactory in 89.9% of cases on postoperative day 7. A favourable neonatal outcome was associated with
booked status, elective caesarean section and use of subarachnoid anaesthesia. The majority of the caesarean
sections were performed as emergencies by Senior Registrars. Adverse neonatal outcome was associated with
unbooked status and indications that necessitated general anaesthesia. The unsatisfactory surgical site was
associated with unbooked status and use of midline incision for the surgery

Haematological Malignancies(HMs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. To the best of our Knowledge, there are no reports on the burden of these neoplasms in this environment. The objective of this study therefore was to determine the pattern of Haematological Malignancies in this region and compare with reports from other studies. Aretrospective review of Haematological Malignancies in adult Nigerians in Uyo, Nigeria, was undertaken using records of patients managed in Haematology Department, University of Uyo Teaching Hospital (UUTH) over an 8-year period (January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2015. Atotal of 127 patients aged 20-79 years were diagnosed with Haematological Malignancies during the study period. The prevalence of the different Haematological Malignancies recorded: Prolymphocytic Leukaemia 1 (0.8%),Primary Myelofibrosis 2 (1.6%),Essential Thrombocythaemia 2 (1.6%), Polycythaemia Vera 8 (6.3%), Myelodysplastic Syndrome 4 (3.1%),Multiple Myeloma 14 (11.0%), Acute Myeloid Leukaemia 4 (3.9%), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia 5 (3.1%), Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia 21 (16.5%), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia 24 (18.9%), Hodgkin's Lymphoma 14(11.0%) and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma 34 (22.0%) .NonHodgkin's Lymphoma constituted the highest prevalence while prolymphocytic Leukaemia was the least seen. This study has shown that Haematological Malignancies are not uncommon in our environment Further research is required therefore to identify the potential risk factors, define the biology, molecular genetics and clinical outcome of these Malignancies in this region .

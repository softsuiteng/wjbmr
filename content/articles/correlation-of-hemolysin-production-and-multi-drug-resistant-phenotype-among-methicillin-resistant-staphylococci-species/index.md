Methicillin-resistant Staphylococci are shown to cause various forms of infections in human with fatal consequences on the health and economy of the patient. This study is aimed at determining the prevalence and antibiotic resistance pattern of methicillin resistant Staphylococci in relation to hemolysin production. A total of 100 clinical samples were screened for Staphylococci spp by standard method. Isolates obtained were tested for methicillin-resistance and susceptibility to other antibiotics by standard procedure. A total of 30 Staphylococcus spp comprising 18 S. aureus and 12 CoagulaseNegative Staphylococci (CoNS) where obtained. Twenty-seven (90%) of the Staphylococci spp were,methicillin resistant comprising 17(94.4%) MRSA and 10(83.3%) MRCoNS. Thirteen (13) resistance profiles were exhibited by MRSA out of which 9 were MDR, while 9 resistance profiles were shown by MRCoNS out of which 5 were MDR. There isa significant correlation in antibiotic resistant phenotype between MRSA and MRCoNS (P=0.01). The result also revealed that 5 and 12 MRSA were b-hemolytic and g-hemolytic respectively, whereas 2 and 8 MRCoNS were b-hemolytic and g-hemolytic respectively. The high prevalence rate of methicillin resistance coupled with high multi-drug resistance phenotype among Staphylococcus spp in the study area is alarming. There is therefore need for periodic or regular surveillance of MRSA and MRCoNS infections not only in the hospital settings but also in the communities.

Inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSBi) resistance, penicillin binding protein 2a (PBP2a)
and virulence factors in Staphylococcus spp from clinical and food samples were detected using erythromycinclindamycin D-zone test, rapid latex agglutination kit and culture media. Seventeen S. aureus and 5 coagulase
negative (CoN) Staphylococcus spp were obtained from food samples, while clinical samples had 18
Staphylococcus spp. The percentage occurrences of Staphylococcus spp in food samples were: 60% (garri),
46.7% (fufu), 40.0 % (rice). One methicillin resistant CoN Staphylococcus spp (MRCoNS) and 7 methicillin
sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) were obtained from clinical samples, while 6 methicillin resistant S. aureus
(MRSA), MSSA (11), MRCoNS (2) and MSCoNS (3) were isolated from food samples. Of the S. aureus (n=13)
and CoN Staphylococcus spp (n=5) obtained from clinical samples, 6 (46.2%) and 2 (40.0%) had PBP2a,
respectively. The results showed that 67.5% staphylococcal isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin; between
52.5% and 60.0% isolates were sensitive to tetracycline and chloramphenicol, while 88.9% MRSA, MSSA and
MRCoNS were clindamycin sensitive. Out of 19 erythromycin resistant isolates, 8 (42.1 %), 6 (31.6 %) and 5
(26.3%) had macrolide-streptogramin, MLSBi and constitutive macrolide lincosamide-streptogramin B
phenotypes, respectively. < 41.7% MRSA produced TNase and protease, between 66.7% to 83.3% MRSA were
DNase, phospholipase and lipase producers, < 83.3 % MSSA produced DNase and haemolysin, 55.6% MSSA
produced amylase, while < 16.7 % MSSA were encapsulated strains. The D-zone test for detection of MLSBi in
Staphylococcus spp should be a part of routine antibiotic susceptibility testing so as to prevent treatment failure.

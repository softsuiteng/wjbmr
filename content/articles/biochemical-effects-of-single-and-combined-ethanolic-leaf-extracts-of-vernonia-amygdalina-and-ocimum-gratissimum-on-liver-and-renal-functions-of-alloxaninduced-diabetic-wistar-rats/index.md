To study the effects of single and combined ethanolic leaf extracts of Vernonia Amygdalina (VA) and Ocimum Gratissimum (OG) on liver and renal functions of alloxan-induced diabetic Wistar rats. Thirty (30) albino Wistar rats of body weights between 100g and 150g were randomly distributed into six (6) groups of five (5) animals each and treated for 14 days. Group 1 animals served as normal control, and were fed with normal feed and water ad libitum while group 2 served as the diabetic control. Groups 3 and 4 were treated orally with 200mg/kg body weight of VAand OG respectively while groups 5 and 6 were treated orally with 100mg/kg body weight each of VAand OG and 5mg/kg body weight of insulin respectively. Parameters measured were serum AST, ALT and ALP levels for liver function as well as serum sodium, chloride, potassium, bicarbonate, urea and creatinine levels for renal function. Results showed a significant (p?0.05) reduction in the fasting blood sugar (FBS) level in the treated groups compared with the diabetic control group. There were also significant (p?0.05) reductions in serum activities of AST, ALT and ALP of the treated groups compared with the diabetic control group. Serum chloride and sodium concentrations across all the groups were not significantly altered, however significant (p?0.05) reductions in serum potassium concentrations and increase in bicarbonate concentrations were observed following extract treatment. Treatments also significantly (p?0.05) reduced the serum concentrations of urea and creatinine when compared to the diabetic control. We therefore conclude that single and combined leaf extracts of Vernonia Amygdalina and Ocimum Gratissimum can be a source of new drugs for effective management of diabetes and the associated diabetic nephropathy.

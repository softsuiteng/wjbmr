Oral contraceptives (OCs) are the most mainstream sort of conception prevention. The pills stop
ovulation and keep the ovaries from delivering eggs. The study aims to evaluate the effect of oral
contraceptive on the histology and biochemistry of the Liver and Kidney using female albino rat.
Twelve animals were grouped into three groups of four animals (n=3). Group I served as a control;
Group II were administered oral contraceptives for seven (7) days while Group III received oral
contraceptive for the period of fourteen (14) days. The animals were treated for twenty-one days (21)
days, at the end of which they were anaesthetized under Chloroform, sacrificed and their blood serum
was collected for biochemical assays. The Livers and Kidneys were collected for histological studies.
The result showed the variation in selected Kidney function parameters of rat treated with 0.75mg of
Postinor-2, a synthetic hormone. There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in Urea and Creatinine in
the group served with OCs. Postinor-2 was observed to have a significant time-dependent impact on K,
Cl and Na levels. Animals in group 2 experienced no significant increase or decreased (p>0.05) in the
level of ALP, ALT, AST and Bilirubin but those in group 3 were significant (p<0.05) when compared
with the control group. Histological sections reveal distorted tubules and vessels. Frequent use of OCs
could cause deregulation of the extracellular fluid level, hypertensive disorder, renal and hepatic
impairment.

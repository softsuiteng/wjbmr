Mobile blood drive is an important strategy for increasing the pool of voluntary blood donors; however the  major challenge is the retention of these donors, especially the first time donors. This study was designed to determine the proportion of blood donors who expressed satisfaction with the blood donation process during blood drive campaigns, determine if any, association between overall satisfaction of donors in relation to the donation process as well as the motivating factors to future blood donation by the donors. A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted; participants were recruited using consecutive sampling technique. Data on socio-demography, blood donation history of donors, frequency of blood donation by repeat donors, rating of the donation process, level of satisfaction with the process and motivating factors for future blood donation among other information were obtained from consented blood donors using self-administered questionnaire soon after the donation exercise. Data was analyzed using SPSS for Windows Version 17.0. Significant level was set at p < 0.05. Majority of the donors were youths in their mid-twenties and thirties. Their mean age was 26.93 Â± 4.19 years. Agood number (98.3%) expressed satisfaction with the entire blood donation process. First time donors were more satisfied with the process than the repeat donors. There was a statistically significant association between donor's satisfaction and their intention to donate in future (p=0.002). Altruism (to save lives) and incentives such as receiving souvenirs, blood donation certificate, provision of transport fare and operating flexible donation time were the major motivating factors toward future blood donation. In conclusion, the satisfaction of donors regarding the blood donation process was positively associated with their intention to donate again in future. Besides altruism, incentives such as souvenirs, issuing blood donation certificates and operating a flexible blood time among others are important motivating factors to future blood donation.

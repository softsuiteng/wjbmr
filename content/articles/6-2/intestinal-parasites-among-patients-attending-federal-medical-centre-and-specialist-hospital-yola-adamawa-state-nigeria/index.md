Intestinal parasites are identified as a cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world particularly in the developing countries. This research was conducted to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites and the risk factors for specific and multiple infections among patients attending Federal Medical Centre and Specialist Hospital, Yola, Adamawa State, Nigeria. The unsanitary environment and indiscriminate defaecation in Yola communities and environs is common. People commonly move bare-footed; and consumption of contaminated foods and water which leads to
increase in diarrhoeal cases among inhabitants. Four hundred and twenty-three (423) stool samples were randomly collected and analyzed in the laboratory using saline wet mount procedure and formal ether concentration technique. Of the 423, 103(24.3%) had intestinal parasites with a total of seven parasite species were observed. The frequency of occurrence of intestinal parasites from the stools examined indicates that Entamoeba histolytica was the most predominant 32(7.6%), and Ascaris lumbricoides was least predominant 8(1.9%). Co-infection with Hymenolepis nana and Gardia lamblia was also observed 2(0.5%). Prevalence of intestinal parasites was higher in males 71(16.8%)
than in females 32(7.6%); while according to age groups, it was higher among 11-20 years old 36(8.6%) and lowest among 41 and above years old -10(2.4%). There was statistically significant difference between intestinal parasitic infection and gender (P<0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference between intestinal parasitic infection and age (P>0.05). This finding provides data for understanding the epidemiological status of the human gastrointestinal parasites which would be useful in the effective formulation and control of the parasitic diseases.

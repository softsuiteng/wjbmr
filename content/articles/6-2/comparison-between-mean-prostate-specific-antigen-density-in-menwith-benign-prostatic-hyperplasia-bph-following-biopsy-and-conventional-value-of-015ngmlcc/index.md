Prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) is a volume corrected prostate specific antigen (PSA). It has been a very useful tool in discriminating between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer especially in the gray zone of the PSA (4-10ng/ml). The guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate malignancy prescribes 0.15ng/ml per volume of prostate tissue as the cut-off value to enhance diagnostic suspicion of prostate cancer. This study was aimed at comparing the mean value of PSAD in our cohort of patients with the conventional value. Seventy-one patients with histological diagnosis of BPH were evaluated between January 2016 and December 2017. Their clinical information wascollated including bio-data, important findings on history and physical examination, imaging studies and prostate biopsy results. Data were analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. The patients were aged between 50 and 85 years with a mean age of 64.79±8.09 years. Mean PSA was 4.95±3.24ng/ml, while mean prostate volume and PSAD were 73.20±57.82mls and 0.078±0.55ng/ml/ccrespectively. Using one samplet-test for data
analysis, there was significant difference in means (.0716);P-value was set at 0.05. There was a marked difference in means between the PSAD values which was also statistically significant.

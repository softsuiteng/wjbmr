Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy is indicated in patients presenting with symptoms of upper gastrointestinal disease as it provides accurate assessment of the underline disease thereby allowing for appropriate therapeutic intervention. Our aim was to report UGI endoscopic findings in a private health facility in Gusau, Zamfara State, North-West, Nigeria. A 3-year review of all patients that had upper gastrointestinal endoscopy between January 2016 and December 2018. Information was retrieved from the endoscopy register andanalyzed with SPSS 22 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Amonk, NY: IBM Inc). Three hundred and thirteen patients had endoscopy procedure. One hundred and seventy-two (55%) were males and 141(45%) were females with M: F ratio of 1.2: 1. Their mean age was 43.19Â±15.9 years with a range of 12 to 85 years. The commonest diagnostic indications were suspected peptic ulcer disease 138(44.1%) followed by dyspepsia 77(24.6%). Chronic gastritis was the commonest endoscopic finding, 88(28.1%) followed by gastroesophageal reflux disease. Gastric cancer and oesophageal cancer accounted for 7% and 0.3%, respectively. Forty-eight (15.3%) had normal endoscopic findings. Suspected peptic ulcer disease was the commonest indication for UGI endoscopy while gastritis was the commonest finding. High prevalence of malignancy was noted in our study and significant percentage of patients presenting for upper GI endoscopy had normal findings. Suspected clinical diagnosis performed poorly in predicting endoscopic findings.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems all over the world have shaped their organization to cope with the emergency. Overall, these adjustments led to a significant decrease in clinical and training activities. To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on anaesthesia trainees and their training programme. A structured questionnaire consisting of three parts was sent to all the resident doctors in the department of Anaesthesia, University of Uyo Teaching Hospital through WhatsApp as a Microsoft Word file. The residents were directed to answer the questions completely and return same to the researchers. The questionnaire contained 26 questions, most of which required a 'yes'er 'No' answer. Fifteen anaesthesia residents were recruited, 87% of the respondents had a good knowledge of the management protocol of patients with COVID-19 with respect to Anaesthesia/TCU. Six (40%) were infected with COVID-19, 5 of whom were treated in self isolation settings in their homes, while only one was treated in public isolation center. They all recovered fully. All the respondents, 15(100%) held a consensus opinion that training activities were generally reduced, 87413) maintained that virtual meetings was the commonest medium of training. COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on anaesthesia trainees and their training programme, however, it introduced the virtual platform as a new normal medium of training.

Human T cell lymphotropic virus belongs to the Retroviridae family, Oncovirinae subfamily, genus
Deltaretrovirus, Group VI, positive sense, ssRNA virus and has been linked to the Adult T cell
leukaemia/lymphoma, and neurologic disorder called tropical spastic paraparesis. This study was carried out
to determine the prevalence of Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 and 2 among blood donors at Aminu
Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH). A total of ninety one (91) fit blood donors were recruited at the donor clinic
AKTH and were screened for HTLV 1 and 2 by Enzyme Linked ImmunosorbentAssay (ELISA).
Seroprevalence of HTLV 1 and 2 among the study subjects was 1.1%. This showed that the virus is in
circulation in Kano community. There is need for expanded community based study on HTLV among
prospective blood donors in Kano State and Nigeria in general to ascertain the actual prevalence of this virus so
as to minimize the risk of transferring of the virus from infected individual to non infected person.

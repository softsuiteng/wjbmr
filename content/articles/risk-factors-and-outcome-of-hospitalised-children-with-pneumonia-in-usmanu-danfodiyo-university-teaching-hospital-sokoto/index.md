Childhood pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries,contributing to global under-five mortality. Several risk factors have been identified to contribute to the development of the disease. The study determined the association between the risk factors and outcome of hospitalized children with pneumonia in our institution. This was a retrospective study conducted in children admitted primarily for pneumonia during the study period. A structured questionnaire was used for the data collection and relevant information were documented. One hundred and eighty nine children were reviewed of which 141(74.6%) children had identifiable risk
factor of pneumonia. Majority 123(65.0%) belonged to the low SEC, 152(80.4%) were not exclusively breast fed, 22(11.1%) were malnourished, 95(50.3%) were fully immunized and only 13(6.9%) had source of unclean cooking fuel documented. One hundred and fifty-two (80.4%) were discharged while 37(19.6%) died. Presence of diarrhoeal disease (p=0.001), poor immunization status (0.016), low SEC (0.004) and low paternal education (p=0.048) were significantly associated with mortality. Multivariate logistic regression showed diarrhoeal disease (OR:3.7, 95% CI:1.5-8.9), p =0.003) and
poor immunization status (OR:0.38, 95% CI: 0.16-0.88, p=0.024) were significant independent predictive risk factors of mortality. Risk factors of pneumonia are strongly associated with poor outcome and need to be identified as priorities during patient evaluation. Some of these risk factors are preventable, strengthening health education and health promotion can reduce the high morbidity and mortality from pneumonia

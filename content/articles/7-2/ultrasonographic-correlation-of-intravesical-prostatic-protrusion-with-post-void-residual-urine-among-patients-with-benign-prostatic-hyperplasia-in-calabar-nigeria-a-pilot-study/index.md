Bladder outlet obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a distressing situation, impacting negatively on patients' quality of life, so early detection is apt. Ultrasonography is a viable alternative to an invasive pressure flow meter for predicting bladder outlet obstruction. There is a dearth of work on the use of intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) as an ultrasonographic parameter in Nigeria and there might be racial variations similar to the observation with prostate volume. This study aims to sonographically assess the grade of IPP associated with significant post-void residual (PVR) urine volume. Sixty-three consecutive newly diagnosed BPH patients referred from the general outpatient department were recruited into the study over 18 months. Sonoscape A8 Ultrasound
machine was used for the Trans-abdominal pelvic assessment. The measured IPP was graded as <5mm(I), 5-10mm (II) and >10mm (III) and the PVR urine volume as <50ml, 50 -100ml and >100ml. The prostate volumes were also stratified into four before correlating all the parameters. A post-void residual urine volume of 100ml was chosen as the threshold that defines obstruction due to the patients' average age (61.69 years). It was observed that 39.68% of all the patients had significant PVR urine volume. Across all prostate volume groups, only grade III IPP (>10mm) caused a significant mean PVR urine volume (111.76ml). Grade III was responsible for most of the significant PVR urine
volume and 96.83% occurred at a prostate volume greater than 40ml.

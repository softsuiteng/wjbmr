Escherichia coli has been implicated in several outbreaks of neonatal sepsis leading to meningitis in many countries especially in developing nations. However, there is dearth of epidemiologic information on Escherichia coli colonisation in neonates, mothers and healthcare workers in Nigeria and Akwa Ibom state in particular. This study was aimed at determining the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of E. coli isolated from neonates, their mothers and healthcare workers (HCWs) in University of Uyo Teaching Hospital (UUTH), Uyo. A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted by collecting swab samples from 310 neonates, 168 consented mothers and 35 HCWs in Sick Babies' unit (SBU), Special Care Babies' unit (SCBU) and neonatal ward of the hospital. Escherichia coli was isolated and identified using standard microbiological procedures. Out of the 310 neonates, 38(12.3%) yielded E. coli, of which 20(52.6%) were from SBU, 18(47.4%) from SCBU and none from neonatal ward. Maternal E. coli carriage was 82(48.8%) out of 168 tested, of which 34(41.5%) were from mothers in SBU, 37(45.1%) from SCBU and 11(13.4%) from neonatal ward. Carriage among nurses and ward orderlies was 318.6%), distributed as 1(33.3%) and 2(66.7%) from SBU and SCBU respectively. E. coli from neonates and mothers had low resistance to clavulanated amoxycillin (2.6% and 1.2% respectively), whereas higher resistance were observed among the quinolones (31.7%-39.5%) and third generation cephalosporins (29.3% -39.5%). The three E. coli isolates from HCW's exhibited 100% resistance to all antimicrobial agents except clavulanated amoxycillin and gentamycin. 2(66.7%) each. There is evidence of neonatal and maternal colonisation of E. coli in UUTH. Uyo, as well as among HCWs. Neonates in sick babies' unit were more at risk of colonisation than other units. Very high antimicrobial resistance was observed among E. coli isolates from HCWs, while resistance to clavulanated amoxycillin was generally low. There is a compelling need to create effective educational programmes for mothers and HCW's during antenatal and perinatal periods to reduce the rate of E. coli carriage in neonates

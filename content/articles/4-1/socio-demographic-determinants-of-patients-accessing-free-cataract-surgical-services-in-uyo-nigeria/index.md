Globally, cataract blindness is the commonest, yet surgical intervention as a means of treatment is one of the
most rewarding surgical interventions known because of the expected good visual outcome. Sadly, there are
certain undetermined factors militating against accessing cataract surgeries. In our locality, no study has
explored these factors. The objective of the study was to determine socio-demographic factors common to
patients who had free cataract surgeries during an Eye Camp in Uyo, Nigeria. The study design was prospective
and non-randomized of individuals who had free cataract surgeries during the period. During the one month
program, Two Hundred and Fifty Three patients (n = 253) were operated upon; 146 (57.7%) were males and
107 (42.3%) were females with a mean age 59.50Â±14.1. Most participants were rural dwellers (152; 60.1%).
Financial handicap was the commonest reason for delay in accessing cataract surgical services. In conclusion:
Poor financial status of the participants was the main reason for delay in accessing treatment for cataract.
Other identified barriers to cataract service uptake were fear of surgical outcome and non-maturity of
cataracts.

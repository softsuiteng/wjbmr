Parasitic infections and their effects on both nutritional and health status of pregnant women are of serious
global concern because of their high propensity in causing maternal deaths, still birth, low birth rate and
fertility impairment. A survey of parasitic infections was carried out on pregnant women who attended
maternity clinics at Mary Slessor General Hospital, Itu and St. Luke's Hospital, Anua-Uyo in Akwa Ibom State
of Nigeria to determine the parasite burden of the pregnant women. Samples of skin snips, blood, stool, vaginal
swabs and urine were collected from the pregnant women at the maternity sections of the hospitals, over a
period of 10 months, and analyzed using standard parasitological methods. Of the 572 pregnant women
screened, 79(13.8%) were infected by one or more of the identified parasites. The parasites identified include
Plasmodium falciparum (4.7%), Ancylostoma duodenale (3.5%), Ascaris lumbricoides (2.3%), and
Trichomonas vaginalis (2.6%). Multigravid Pregnant women who had multi-infections were found to have
haemoglobin levels <11.0g/dl (anaemia in pregnancy) and delivered babies with very low birth weights
(<3.0kg). There was no adverse effect on the pregnant women associated with Ascaris lumbricoides except
where there were multiple infections with other parasites like hookworm and Plasmodium falciparum. There
were no cases of Onchocerca volvulus among the pregnant women. Control measures should be put in place to
sensitize pregnant women on the possible preventive measures against malaria, other protozoan parasites, and
helminthic parasites in the study areas.

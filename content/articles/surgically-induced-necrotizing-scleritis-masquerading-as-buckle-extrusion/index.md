A case of surgically induced necrotizing scleritis (SINS) after 360 degrees circumferential buckling in
a 62 years old man. Surgery was uneventful and patient-reported improved vision few days after
surgery. However, about a week after surgery he noticed boring pain that became progressively severe.
Vision started to decrease but no photophobia. Patient defaulted and did not report for check-up until
one month after surgery. Ocular examination revealed a mildly edematous lid, clear cornea and a
band-like necrosed sclera at 4 to 8 0'clock quadrant. On a cursory look, the sclera necrosis was thought
to be an extruded silicone tire. The anterior chamber was clear with no hypopyon. The retina was
attached. High index of clinical suspicion is required to differentiate scleral necrosis from buckle
extrusion in some instances. This report highlights a case of sceral necrosis masquerading as buckle
extrusion.

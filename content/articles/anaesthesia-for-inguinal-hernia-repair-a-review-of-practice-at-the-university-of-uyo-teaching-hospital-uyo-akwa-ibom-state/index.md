Elective surgical repair of an inguinal hernia is one of the common surgical procedures. Local, regional and general Anaesthesia are all used for hernia repair, but to different degrees depending on some factors. We reviewed Anaesthesia practice for inguinal hernia repair in our centre. The study seeks to compare the safety profiles of the different techniques of Anaesthesia for inguinal hernia repair and the degree to which each technique was used during the period under review. This was a retrospective study of all inguinal hernia repairs performed from January 2011 to December 2013. Data were obtained from Anaesthetic chat, theatre and ward registers. Information collected were as follows: age, sex, ASA physical status, type of hernia, type of repair, type of Anaesthesia, use of sedation, conversion to general Anaesthesia, complications and whether the patient was admitted or treated as a day case. One hundred and forty one hernia repairs were performed. Spinal Anaesthesia was the dominant Anaesthetic technique (47 5%), followed by local Anaesthesia (34.1%), and general Anaesthesia (18.4%). Of those who received either local or spinal Anaesthesia the use of sedation was higher in the local Anaesthesia group (84.7% vs 41.6%), whereas more patients in the spinal group were converted to general Anaesthesia compared to local Anaesthesia group (66.6% vs 33.3%). Spinal Anaesthesia was associated with more Anaesthetic complications compared to local and general Anaesthesia. Day case rate was higher in the local Anaesthesia group (84.6%) compared to spinal (16.8) and general (7.2%) groups. The study revealed that local Anaesthesia is the safest technique of Anaesthesia when compared to spinal and general Anaesthesia, but its practice is rather low. We therefore recommend a greater use of local Anaesthesia for inguinal hernia repair.

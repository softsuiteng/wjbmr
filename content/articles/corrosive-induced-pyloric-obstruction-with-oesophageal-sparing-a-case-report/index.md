We report an unusual case of isolated gastric outlet obstruction following ingestion of corrosive liquid by a 25
year old male banker who attempted suicide. He presented with features of gastric outlet obstruction three
months following intentional ingestion of car battery fluid of concentrated sulphuric acid in an attempt to take
his own life. Prior to this, patient had been on suspension from office as a result of some problems he had with
his employers. He however had no prior history of psychiatric illness or peptic ulcer disease. Barium meal
confirmed antro-pyloric stenosis with dilated proximal stomach and normal oesophagus. The patient
underwent nutritional rehabilitation with supplemental parental and oral high calorie, high protein diet to
regain some weight and offered restorative gastro-jejunostomy to by-pass the stenosis. He recovered
uneventfully and had remained stable on follow up visits. Acids usually cause more damage to the stomach than
the oesophagus but in this case the oesophagus escaped any form of injury thereby highlighting the relative
resistance of the oesophageal mucosa to acid ingestion.

Non-adherence to prescribed medications in chronic illness requiring long term treatment remains one of the most important modifiable risk factors for suboptimal treatment outcomes in healthcare delivery services worldwide. This study was conducted to assess treatment non-adherence and its correlates in subjects with schizophrenia and diabetes mellitus. This was a cross-sectional study conducted on a sample of one hundred and twenty three out-patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and diabetes mellitus respectively, They were assessed for treatment adherence and attitude to medications using self report questionnaires. Multivariate analysis was used to determine significant predictor variables associated with suboptimal treatment adherence. The mean age of participant was 36.02±11.8 for schizophrenia and 59.68±11.3 for diabetes mellitus. Subjects with diabetes (70.7%) were comparatively more likely to comply with medications compared to subjects with schizophrenia (52.8%) (p= 0.04). Adherence to treatment was significantly associated in all study groups with treatment supervision (p= 0.01) and attitude to medication (p= 0.01). Suboptimal treatment adherence among patients on long-term medication is common but appears to be greater among the mentally ill compared to the physically ill. There is need to improve adherence through strategic interventions targeting both patients and caregivers.

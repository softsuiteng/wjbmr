Neisseria gonorhoeae is an agent of a highly contagious eye infection called Gonococcal keratoconjunctivitis. Gonococcal eye infection in adults is not very common, so the clinical diagnosis may be delayed without high suspicion index. Neonatal infection also known as gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum affect babies during the passage through the birth canal of an infected mother, but sporadic cases observed in older children as well as adults typically has source as someone who has a genital infection with accidental infection of the eye. We hereby present two cases of bilateral purulent keratoconjunctivitis in adult patients with gram-negative intracellular diplococci, with a positive sexual history with a commercial sex worker in one of them.

Dogs are known to perform series of functions that are beneficial in the human society and also have been known to cause environmental contamination and inconveniences as a result of their defaecation and urination. In addition, these dogs habour a variety of potential pathogenic intestinal parasites that constitute major threat to public health. A total of 328 faecal samples of dogs obtained by house to house collection were examined microscopically. The overall prevalence was 61.6%. Six helminth parasites namely Toxocara canis, Diphyllobotrium latum, Dipylidium caninum, Ancylostoma spp, Uncineria stenocephala and Strongyloides stercoralis were recovered. Dogs from the ages of 60 months and above had the highest prevalence of 19.2% while those not more than 12 months recorded the lowest prevalence of 10.4%. There was no statistical significant difference in the sex-related prevalence. Dogs should be checked from depositing their faeces in areas like playgrounds where children come in contact with them. Regular mass faecal examination for dogs is also strongly advocated.

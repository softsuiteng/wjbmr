Diseases of the thyroid gland are common, and they can occur in any individual irrespective of the race. This retrospective study was designed to review of all haematoxylin and eosin stained slides of thyroid diseases diagnosed in the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Nigeria between January 2003 and December 2009 to determine the pattern of thyroid diseases among patients in the centre. The demographic data and clinical information about the patients were obtained from their case notes. A total of 62 thyroid biopsies from 55 females and 7 males were analysed during the period of the study. The age of patients with thyroid diseases ranged from 12 years to 90 years, with a peak age incidence of 74.2% in the 21- 50 years age group . The mean ages of 42.1 years, 38.0 years and 55.8 years were recorded for goiters, adenomas and carcinomas respectively. Multinodular goiter was the most common (46.8%) thyroid disease, and it accounted for highest numbers of non-neoplastic disease, being responsible for 58% of cases. Colloid goiters, toxic goiters and non-toxic goiters were the other types seen in 26.0%, 10.0% and 6.0% of cases respectively. Benign tumours were predominantly follicular adenoma type, accounting for 6 out of 12 cases of neoplastic diseases. Papillary carcinoma was the most frequent malignant tumour, accounting for 50% (3 out of 6) of malignant tumours. Follicular carcinoma was responsible for two (2) cases while medullary carcinoma accounted for one case. In conclusion, multinodular goiter was the most common thyroid diseases among patients in Sagamu, Nigeria with a predilection for females. Follicular adenoma and papillary carcinoma were the predominant benign and malignant thyroid tumours respectively.

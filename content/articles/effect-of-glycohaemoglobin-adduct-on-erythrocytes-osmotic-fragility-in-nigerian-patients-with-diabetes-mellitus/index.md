Anemia is one of the common complications in subjects with diabetes mellitus (DM); this could be
attributed to a number of causes. One of which could be due to continuous intracellular influx of
glucose resulting from non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin and this may alter erythrocyte
membrane architecture or cell mass. We aimed to investigate the impact of haemoglobin glycosylation
on erythrocytes osmotic fragility in subjects with DM attending Murtala Muhammad Specialist
Hospital, Kano.To achieve this, fasting plasma glucose level, concentration of glycated haemoglobin
(HbA C) in subjects with DM were assayed. The erythrocyte osmotic fragility of DM was compared with 1
controls. Seventy-five participants were enrolled including 50(66.7%) DM and 25(33.3%) control
subjects Participants were both males and females within the age of 23-72 years, with (Mean ± SD =
52.46±13.98 and 40.52±10.77years for DM and controls, respectively).The fasting plasma glucose
(FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA C) and erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF) were determined 1
colorimetrically using glucose oxidase-peroxidase, ion exchange resin and gradient hypotonic saline
methods. In this study, there was significant difference (P<0.05) of FPG and HbA C of DM compared 1
to controls. HbA C correlates positively with FPG in diabetic subjects. There were statistically 1
significant differences (p < 0.05) between FPG, HbA C and EOF levels of DM subjects compared to 1
controls. We inferred that high EOFin DM subjects reported in our study may contribute to chronic
anaemia seen in this disease.

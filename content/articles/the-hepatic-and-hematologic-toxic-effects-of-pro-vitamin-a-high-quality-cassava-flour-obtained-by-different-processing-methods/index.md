The hepatic and hematologic toxic effect of Pro-Vitamin A High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF) by
different processing methods was studied in male albino Wistar rats, fed for 28days on the Cassava diet
- -1
containing 4.794mgCN kg and 10% protein supplement, using spectrophotometry, enzyme assay and
automated haematology analyzer. There was significant increase in the serum Glucose concentration,
serum activity of Aspartate Aminotransferase and Alanine Aminotransferase of the test animals
compared to the control, whereas the serum total protein concentrations showed a significant decrease
between the test and control groups. The hematology studies showed no significant difference (p >
0.05)between the test and control groups. Toxicity study suggested that the in vivo metabolism of ProVitamin A HQCF was capable of altering some biochemical parameters such as elevation of serum
Glucose concentration and some enzymes such as Aspartate Aminotransferase and Alanine
Aminotransferase, whereas a reduction in serum total protein concentration was observed. The
findings indicated that the processing methods (most especially oven dry) have reduced the toxicity of
HQCF to a minimum safe level.

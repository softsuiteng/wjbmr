Thyroid antibodies are antibodies against the thyroid gland. Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) is the most significant thyroid autoantibody. An increased level suggest the manifestation of autoimmune mechanisms that leave individuals susceptible to other autoimmune diseases and conditions. This study sought to compare the level of TPO-Ab in diabetics and hypertensives with apparently healthy people. It was hoped that a significant difference might add merit to the use of TPO-Ab as an early marker of thyroid dysfunction. A total of 80 participants attending diabetic and hypertensive clinics in Kano were recruited as the test group for the study; 44 were diabetic, 33 were hypertensive and 8 were both hypertensive and diabetic. 20 Apparently-healthy individuals free from diabetes and hypertension served as the control group. The mean ± standard deviation of the age of diabetic subjects was found to
be 51.57 ± 14.17 and ranged between 22 and 82 years while the mean ± standard deviation of the age of hypertensive subjects was 52.91 ± 11.34. The mean ± standard deviation of serum TPO-Ab was found to be 20.92 ± 9.4, and 13.34 ± 9.34, and 14.80 ± 5.52 respectively in diabetics, hypertensive patients and the control group. A t-test showed no statistically significant difference in diabetics and hypertensiveswhen compared to the control group. In conclusion, while the increased level of TPO-Ab in diabetics confirms the links between thyroid autoimmunity and diabetes, TPO-Ab is unsuitable as an early marker of thyroid dysfunction in diabetics and hypertensives.

This study was carried out to structure the processes involved in obtaining HIV prevalence data from trauma patients and thus explore the option of using this subset of patients as an additional cohort to the routine use of antenatal patients, for Nigerian National HIV prevalence estimates. Trauma patients presenting to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) unit of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital who met the inclusion criteria, were enrolled into this cross-sectional study. The type of major injury was noted in most of the patients and the difficulties in obtaining blood samples for HIV antibody tests were enumerated. The process of obtaining the data was contrasted with the National HIVAntenatal care survey. There were 100 patients from whom blood samples were obtained for HIV antibody tests, from October to December 2008 and the HIV prevalence was 5%. The major inury in 30% of the patients was fracture(s), while 27% of them had head injury. The major difficulty with obtaining blood samples for HIV antibody tests were a refusal of the patient to give consent, and the inability to conduct pre-HIV test counseling due to the lack of trained counselors. The major difficulties noted with obtaining blood for HIV tests can be overcome in a sentinel study, in which individual consent and pre-HIV test counseling are not required. Trauma patients are a reasonable subset to be further explored as an additional cohort for the comprehensive determination of the Nigeria National HIVprevalence.

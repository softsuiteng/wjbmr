Healthcare workers are predisposed to cardiovascular diseases just as the patients they manage. Dyslipidaemia
has been identified as an important cardiovascular risk factor among the healthcare workers. Elevated LDLcholesterol and triglyceride along with reduced HDL-cholesterol have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Deposition of proatherogenic lipids along the wall of the blood vessels
forms the basis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. This study determined the prevalence of
dyslipidaemia among the healthcare workers in University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH), Benin City,
South-South, Nigeria. Three hundred and twenty-five hospital workers ranging from doctors, nurses and other
healthcare workers were recruited for this study. Demographic and socioeconomic data were collected using a
structured questionnaire. One hundred and sixty (49%) were males while 165(51%) were females with

average age of 40.9 ± 8.8 years and average body mass index of 26.7 ± 5.9kg/m . Anthropometric and blood
pressure measurements were determined using standard techniques while the serum lipids (triglyceride, total
cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol) were analyzed using the standard enzymatic methods.
Abnormal lipid levels were found in the study population. Total cholesterol (5.06 ± 1.33 mmol/L), LDLcholesterol (3.66 ± 1.38mmol/L) and non HDL-cholesterol (4.08 ± 1.37 mmol/L) were elevated. Serum HDLcholesterol (0.98 ± 0.14 mmol/L) was found to be low. Prevalence of dyslipidaemia was reported as follow:
elevated total cholesterol (43.4%), elevated LDL-cholesterol (56.0%), and reduced HDL-cholesterol (82.2%).
Significant risk factors identified include: physical inactivity (32%) and alcohol ingestion (53.5%). Prevalence
of dyslipidaemia is high among the healthcare workers in UBTH; most especially reduced HDL-cholesterol
and elevated LDL-cholesterol. Therapeutic lifestyle modification is therefore advocated among the healthcare
workers to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Malaria infection during infancy greatly mimics infections caused by other pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. This similarity in symptomatology and clinical presentation of malaria compared to other infections makes its diagnosisparticularly difficult. The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness or not of certain clinical signs in the diagnosis of malaria in febrile infants attending the Children's Emergency Room of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital and General Hospital, Surulere. Three hundred and twenty two consecutively presenting infants who were febrile either at presentation or had a history of fever in the last 72 hours prior to presentation with absence of obvious localizing causes for the fever were recruited into the study between August 2001- February 2002. Each patient had a full history and physical examination and blood samples were obtained for malaria parasite counts and specie identification. Out of 322 infants, one hundred and forty six infants were females and 176 were males giving a M: F ratio 1.2:1.Amongst the clinical signs elicited in the children, only anaemia (haematocrit<33%) showed a significant association with the presence of malaria parasitaemia (P = 0.00035). Calculation of the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the clinical signs showed no sensitivity for their use in the diagnosis of malaria in infants. Clinical signs such as fever, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were not found to be useful in this study as an aid in diagnosing malaria in infancy. Anaemia had a significant association with malaria parasitaemia but had a low overall sensitivity as a sign that could be used for diagnosing malaria in infants.

Information on vision screening among groups of workers is sparse in Uyo, the cosmopolitan capital of Akwa Ibom State. Uyo Mechanic Village provided a virile ground to conduct a vision survey being a congregation of workers that deal with sales of auto-spare parts, repairs of automobile and other ancillary businesses. Thepbjective of this study was to determine ocular health status of workers in mechanic village in Uyo, Nigeria. A cross-sectigal study of ocular health status was conducted among workers in the mechanic village, Uyo. In addition to the socio-demographic profile, ocular examinations were carried out using Snellen's chart and pin-hole, pen-light, direct ophthalmoscope and Perkins hand held tonometer. Data obtained was analyzed with Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 20.0. Chi-squared test along with p-value was used as a test of statistical significance. The mean age of the workers was 37.69.2 years. About 95% had unaided visual acuity >6/18 in either eye. Presbyopia (56.9%) was the commonest ocular finding. Allergic conjunctivitis was seen in 16.5%, dry eye syndrome 13.8%, refractive errors 11.9% and pterygium/pingueculum 9.2%. Although majority of the subjects had ocular disorders amenable to spectacle correction, only 14 of 76 (18.4%) subjects with either presbyopia or refractive error were either using glasses or had used glasses before, 28.6% (4 out of 14) of which were non-prescribed. There was no statistically significant relationship between diagnoses and age, P=0.24 and diagnoses and occupation, P=0.62. Presbyopia/refractive error was the commonest finding in our study.

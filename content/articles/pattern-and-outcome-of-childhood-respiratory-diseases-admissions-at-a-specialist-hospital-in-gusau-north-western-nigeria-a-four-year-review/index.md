Respiratory diseases are common causes of childhood morbidity and mortality as well as hospital admission
globally with higher under five mortality especially in low income countries. Studies on specific childhood
respiratory illnesses in different parts of the world have been reported but few reported on combined pattern
and burden of the diseases. Indeed there are few published works in Nigeria and other developing countries. To
determine the prevalence and pattern of childhood respiratory disease admissions, seasonal frequency and
outcome. A retrospective observational study of respiratory disease admissions into the Emergency Paediatric
Unit (EPU)over a 4 year period. Relevant information retrieved included month of presentation, age, gender,
primary diagnosis and outcome. Results were analyzed accordingly with the level of significance set at p £ 0.05.
Five hundred and fifty-four of the 4315 children admitted during the study period had respiratory diseases,
giving a prevalence of 12.8%. Males were 309(55.8%) with a M:F ratio of 1.3:1. Mean age (±SD) was 2.62 ±
(2.50) years. Majority (81.9%) were Under-fives. Pneumonia constituted 315(56.9%), followed by
pharyngotonsillitis 173(31.2%), and then pulmonary tuberculosis 19(3.4). Majority (91.7%) were discharged,
while 37(6.7%) died, with more deaths seen in pneumonia; though asthma had the highest case fatality rate
(18.2%). Prevalence and pattern of respiratory diseases remains high and show similarities in developing
countries with under-fives being more vulnerable. Pneumonia, pharyngotonsillitis and pulmonary
tuberculosis were the commonest causes of respiratory admission. Majority of the patients were discharged,
with more deaths observed in children with pneumonia.

The use of hormonal contraceptives is on the increase globally and is widely accepted by women of childbearing age in Nigeria. However, it is associated with certain risk factors related to thyroid dysfunction. This study aimed to determine the patterns of thyroid hormone profile in women on hormonal contraceptives in Kano, Nigeria. The study population included 173 women on hormonal contraceptives, and 100 apparently healthy women as the control group. The thyroid profile of both groups was assayed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) procedure. In the case group,
141(81.50%) were Euthyroid, and 32(18.50%) had abnormal thyroid hormonal profile. 17(9.83%) of these had Sick euthyroid syndrome; 11(6.36%) had Subclinical hypothyroidism; 03(1.73%) had Overt hyperthyroidism while 01(0.58%) had Overt hypothyroidism. The thyroid profiles of the control group showed that 71(71.0%) had Euthyroid, while 29(29.0%) had abnormal thyroid hormonal profile. 10(10.0%) had Sick euthyroid syndrome; 6(6.0%) had Subclinical hypothyroidism; 05(5.0%) had T3 thyrotoxicosis; 04(4.0%) had T4 thyrotoxicosis; 03(3.0%) had Overt hypothyroidism and 01(1.0%) had
Overt hyperthyroidism. The percentages of women with abnormal thyroid hormonal profile were significantly higher in the control group than in the case group. There was also a very weak correlation between BMI and serum thyroid hormone levels. This study suggests that hormonal contraceptives do not affect the thyroid profile of women on oral contraceptives.

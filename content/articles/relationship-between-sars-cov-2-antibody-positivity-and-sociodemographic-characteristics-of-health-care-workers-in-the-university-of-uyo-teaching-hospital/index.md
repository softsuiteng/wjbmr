The COVID-19 pandemic is primarily an acute respiratory infection. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the gold standard for diagnosis, antibody assays have also been deployed as a useful screening tool for COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the pattern of COVID-19 immunoglobulin seropositivity among healthcare workers in a tertiary hospital. The study was a cross sectional sero-epidemiological survey of different healthcare workers within the University of Uyo Teaching hospital community. There was a single sampling of volunteer's blood using finger prick to
obtain 5 microlitres (µl) of blood, which was tested immediately for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies (IgM or IgG or both). There were 166 healthcare workers who participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 38.81 ± 7.99 years and ranged from 25-59 years. Positive IgG antibody was found in 47(28.3%) of the study participants. There was no significant difference in IgG positivity between males (27.1%) and females (29%). On univariate analysis, participants that were administrative staff and those that were 30-39 years of age were significantly associated with IgG seropositivity. On multivariate analysis, being an administrative staff, participants having an age range of 30-39 years and those of 40-49 years were significantly associated with IgG seropositivity. Among the various professional cadres, being an administrative staff was significantly associated with having IgG sero-positivity. There is need to strengthen infection prevention and control measures among all healthcare workers.

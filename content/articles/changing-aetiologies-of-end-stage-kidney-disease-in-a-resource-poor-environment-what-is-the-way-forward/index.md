The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide. In most areas of Nigeria, chronic glomerulonephritis has been the most common documented aetiology of incident end-stage kidney disease (ESRD). We reviewed the causes of incident end-stage kidney disease in the last four years of operation. Atrend test was performed to assess statistically significant changes in the incidence of the CKD aetiologies. Four hundred and forty nine incident ESRD patients, mean age 41.4 ± 16.3 years, presented over this period. HIV– related kidney diseases constituted 30.7% of the ESRD patients. This was followed by chronic glomerulonephritis (20.0%); hypertension (13.8%) and diabetes mellitus (13.6%) respectively. There was an increasing trend (p<0.001) of HIV – related kidney diseases over this period. It is expedient to initiate screening measures to detect early CKD among our HIV cohorts as many factors contribute to the development and progression of CKD in this population.

Antibiotics (Tetracycline, Amoxicillin and Metronidazole) are common antimicrobial agents used in the
treatment and prevention of microbial infections. Little is known on the adverse effects of antibiotics on the
testis. We designed the current study to investigate the effects of selected antibiotics (Tetracycline, Amoxicillin
and Metronidazole) on markers of oxidative stress (Malondialdehyde; MDA and Glutathione) and testes in
male Wistar rats. Adult male Wistar rats weighing 190g-250g were randomly allotted to control (Group A),
group B (12mg/100g b.w. of tetracycline), group C (400mg/100g b.w. of metronidazole) and group D (4mg/g
b.w. of amoxicillin). The treatments lasted for 2 weeks. Biochemical assays showed significant increase
(p<0.05) and reduction (p<0.05) in MDA and glutathione levels respectively in all the experimental groups.
Also, abnormal changes were observed in the histology of testes when compared with control. The study
demonstrates that antibiotics (Tetracycline, Amoxicillin and Metronidazole) increased the level of oxidative
stress in male Wistar rats and accompanied with testicular toxicity.

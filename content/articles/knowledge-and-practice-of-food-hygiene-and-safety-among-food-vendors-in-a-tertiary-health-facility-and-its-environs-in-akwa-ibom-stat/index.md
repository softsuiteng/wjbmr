Background: Eating food from vendors is a common practice globally but not without the challenges 
of food borne diseases and deaths. Poor preparation and handling of food by vendors in a hospital 
environment could increase morbidity and mortality from foodborne diseases. The study aimed to 
determine the level of knowledge and practice of food hygiene and safety by food vendors in Uyo, 
Akwa Ibom State. Adescriptive cross-sectional study using a mixed-methods approach was conducted 
among 247 food vendors in the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital and its Environs. Eligible food 
vendors were consecutively enrolled after obtaining consent from them. Data were analyzed using 
Stata version 10.0. The majority 81.4% had good knowledge of food hygiene and safety while good 
practice was reported by 43.7% of the vendors. Only 30.4% were observed to use both aprons and hair 
covers. Predictors of good knowledge of food hygiene and safety were post-secondary education 
(OR=10.5;95% CI=1.61-67.76;P=0.01) and location outside UUTH (OR=0.26; 95% CI=0.09-
0.73;P=0.01). Older age (OR 0.43;95% CI=0.24-0.79; P=0.01), primary education (OR 0.11; 95% 
CI=0.02-0.61;P=0.01), lack of formal training (OR 0.45;,95% CI= 0.24-0.86;P=0.02), location 
outside UUTH (OR 0.48; 95% CI =0.25-0.91; P=0.03) and fair knowledge (OR 0.26; 95% CI= 0.10-
0.68;P=0.01) were predictors of poor practice of food hygiene and safety. Majority of the food vendors 
had a good knowledge of food hygiene and safety. The self-reported practise of food hygiene and safety 
and use of PPEs was poor. Continuous training/workshops and constant monitoring and supervision 
are strongly recommended.

Despite global efforts to end the covid-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy remains a public health issue. Only 9.1% of Nigerians have received at least one dose of the vaccine. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and the factors which affect it. This was a crosssectional study carried out among 348 residents of a community in Kakau ward in Kaduna state. Respondents were selected via a multi-stage sampling technique. Data was collected with an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Analysis was done with IBM SPSS Statistics version 23 and results were presented in frequency tables. Appropriate tests of association were done, and the level of statistical significance was set at 0.05. Only 96(27.6%) of the respondents know that the COVID-19 vaccine is not used to treat the infection. Majority 239(68.7%) do not trust the pharmaceutical companies while only 128(36.7%) of the respondents perceive themselves as being at risk for the disease. Sixty-five of the respondents (18.7%) have taken the vaccine. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 273(78.5%). There is a statistically significant relationship between age and knowledge of Covid-19 infection and the of vaccine with vaccine hesitancy p<0.0001. The prevalence of COVID19 vaccine hesitancy was high among these respondents, and factors associated with it were age, sex, educational level, knowledge, and perception. To address this issue, public health authorities need to target social drivers and improve trust for the vaccine among the populace.

Combretum platypterum is a straggling scandent shrub with ethnomedicinal analgesic, antimicrobial and haemostatic activities. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of aqueous leaf extract of Combretum platypterum on haematological and haemostatic parameters in albino Wistar rats. Experimental rats were shared into five groups, blood samples from the groups were collected by cardiac puncture on days 0, 14 and 28. This study used the automated ERMA autoanalyzer PCE-210N in analyzing the haematological parameters. Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time with kaolin (PTTK) was carried out using the visual clot detection method. Analysis of data on day 14 showed significant decrease in granulocyte count of groups 2 and 3 compared to the control (p<0.05). The platelet count also significantly increased (p<0.05) compared to control with group 2 having the highest increase. The PT and PTTK significantly decreased (p<0.001) compared to control with group 2 having the highest decrease. On day 28 across the groups, the percentage of lymphocytes significantly increased (p<0.001) while the percentage of monocyte and granulocyte significantly decreased (p<0.001) compared to control. The platelet count across the groups significantly increased (p<0.002) compared to control. The PT of groups 4 and 5 showed significant increase (p<0.001) compared to control. The PTTK of groups 3, 4 and 5 significantly increased (p<0.001) compared to control. It was observed that consumption of Combretum platypterum at low doses resulted in procoagulant activity but on lengthy periods at high doses, prolonged clotting time resulted.

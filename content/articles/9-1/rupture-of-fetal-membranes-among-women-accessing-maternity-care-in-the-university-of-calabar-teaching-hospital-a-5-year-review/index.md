Prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) is the rupture of membranes before labour begins. Complications are increased in PROM because of the increased risk of infection, preterm labour and prematurity. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, risk factors and complications of prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) in women accessing maternity care at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar, Nigeria. The study was a retrospective descriptive study that utilized data retrieved from the antenatal ward admission register, case files, theatre records and ward reports of 243 women who were managed for PROM over a 5year period at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH). The data collected was entered into an excel sheet and statistical analysis carried out using STATA 16. There were 9,227 deliveries and 243 cases of PROM giving a prevalence of 2.63% (95% CI 2.32- 2.98%). Many of the women were in the 26 - 30 and 31 - 35years age groups 75(30%) and 68(28%) respectively. The majority of the PROM occurred at gestational age of 37-39 weeks 102(42%). Highest risk factor was Previous history of PROM (36.2%) while 51(20.9%) of patients had no identifiable risk factor. Birth asphyxia was found in 44(18.0%) of babies and Chorioamnionitis in 38(15.4%) of the mothers and there were 32(13.0%) perinatal deaths. PROM constitutes a serious complication of pregnancy requiring proactive antenatal care in mothers at risk and vigilant care in affected mothers to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality.

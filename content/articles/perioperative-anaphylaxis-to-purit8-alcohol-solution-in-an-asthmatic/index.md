Though underreported, perioperative anaphylaxis remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the operating environment. The exposure of the surgical patient to an array of drugs with different pharmacological properties could render diagnosis and identification of the offending agent difficult. The objective of this study was to highlight the need for diligence in the anaesthetic mandement of patients with hyperactive airway disease. We present the case of a 50yr old man scheduled for appendectomy. He was a known asthmatic and controlled hypertensive. The last episode of asthmatic attack was 4daysprior to the procedure. There were no known chemical triggers of asthmatic attack in the patient and no drug allergy. Urinalysis was normal but there was mild elevation of eosinophils on the full blood count. Spinal anaesthesia was established using 2.5ml of 0.5% bupivacaine aftercleaning with povidone-iodine. As soon as surgical skin preparation with a solution of Purit-methylated spirit was commenced, the patient complained of the smell of the solution and difficulty in breathing, and immediately had an acute asthmatic attack. Management was with oxygen by facemask, aminophylline and hydrocortisone intravenously. The Purit-methylated spirit solution was washed off the body of the patient with normal saline. Surgery was rescheduled for the next day where povidone-iodine solution was used as the sole skin preparation solution. There was no repeat of the events of the previous day. The perioperative period was uneventful. The anaesthetist must continuously be alert to the possibility perioperative anaphylaxis when managing patients with hyperactive airway disease.

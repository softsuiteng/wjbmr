This study was designed to evaluate the ameliorating efficiency of the ethanol leaf-extract of Ageratum           
conyzoides on Nigerian Bonnylight crude oil-induced dyslipidemia. Twenty female Wistar rats (120-150g body
weight) were divided into four groups of five rats each. The rats in group I served as the control group and were
oral gavaged 3ml/kg body weight of normal saline; group II gavaged 748.33mg/kg body weight of the extract of
A. conyzoides, which was 20% of the LD (3741.66mg/kg). Group III was oral gavaged 3 ml/kg body weight of 50
NBLCO. This dose was calculated as 20% of the lethal dose (LD ) of 14.14 ml/kg, while group IV animals were 50
gavaged 748.33mg/kg body weight of the extract of A. conyzoides, and 3ml/kg body weight of Nigerian
Bonnylight crude oil (NBLCO). In all cases, doses were applied daily for 31 days according to animal's most
recent body weight.The results showed that while the NBLCO administration to group III animals
significantly reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL-C), it significantly increase levels of total cholesterol
(TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol
(VLDL-C), total lipid (TL) an atherogenic index (AI) compared with control and extract groups (I and II)
(p<0.05). In group IV that A. conyzoides was co-administered with NBLCO, there was a significant increase in
HDL-C level, while TC, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C, TL, and AI were all significantly reduced (p<0.05). It is
evidently demonstrated in this study that NBLCO administration induced dyslipidaemia by increasing the
atherogenic indices with concomitant reduction in HDL-C levels that were ameliorated by co-administration
of ethanol leaf extract of Ageratum conyzoides.

Complement system is an essential part of our body's defense against infections. It helps the cells in our
immune system to better recognize and capture microbes and can also lead to direct elimination of microbes by
destroying their cell membrane. There is increase in the incidence of complement deficiencies globally. There
is paucity of data on complement activity among children especially in our locality. This study was set to
evaluate the AH Complement activity among children with some bacterial and malaria parasite infections. 50
This is a cross sectional study in which71 children with some bacterial and malaria parasite infections
attending Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, were recruited. Blood sample was collected from the children
then processed to obtain a serum. The serum AH was analysed using sandwich enzyme linked 50
Immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The AH activity in the children was found to be between 71.3 U/ml-176.9 50
U/ml. Children whose ages fall between 9-12 years have higher AH activity (94.63 U/ml) compared with other 50
age groups, but statistically not significant. Children diagnosed with malaria parasite have higher AH activity 50 (87.49 U/ml) compared with those diagnosed with bacterial infection (p=0.05). Among the causative
organisms, children with Staphylococcus aureus infection have higher AH activity (88.17 U/ml) compared 50
with other infectious agent, but the differences is not statistically significant. AH activity fall within the assay 50 range this indicate normal activity. There is significant difference in AH activity between children diagnosed 50 with malaria parasites and bacterial infections. Therefore we recommend further research to identify the reasons behind the differences.

The dwindling population of medical doctors worldwide, most especially in Nigeria necessitates the
maintenance of good health among the current medical students who will transform to medical doctors in the
nearest future. Insulin resistance has been identified as the major aetiologic factor for most noncommunicable diseases worldwide. This study determined the prevalence of insulin resistance among the
medical students in University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria. A total of 90 medical students ranging from 18-
35 years old were randomly selected from the medical student population who have spent at least one year in
the school. Thirty-nine (43.3%) of the students were males while 51 (56.7%) were females. Anthropometric,
fasting glucose, insulin and lipid parameters were determined. Insulin resistance was determined using
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Students were categorized based on gender
and levels of their lipid. Biochemical parameters were compared using Students T-test. Homeostasis model
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) among male and female medical students were 0.208±0.20 and
0.624±0.70 respectively (p=0.0002). Female medical students have higher fasting plasma insulin than the
males. The prevalence of insulin resistance among medical students was found to be 3.3%. Prevalence of
insulin resistance among the medical students was low. Though, fasting plasma insulin was a bit higher
among female medical students, there is a need for health education on the effect of insulin resistance among
medical students most especially the females

The advent of neuroimaging like computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging has facilitated
the diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries. Emphasizing certain diagnostic features of some peculiar
traumatic brain injuries. The following lesions of traumatic brain injuries were pictorially depicted,
namely Tension pneumocephalus, Blow out orbit, Bilateral subacute subdural haematomata, Acute-onchronic subdural haematoma, Middle cranial fossa acute epidural haematoma, Traumatic basal ganglial
haematoma and Acute intra-ventricular haematoma. Mount Fuji sign is typical of tension
pneumocephalus while herniation of extra-ocular muscles into the maxillary sinus is diagnostic of blowout orbit. Rabbit ear appearance is observable in bilateral subacute subdural haematomata.

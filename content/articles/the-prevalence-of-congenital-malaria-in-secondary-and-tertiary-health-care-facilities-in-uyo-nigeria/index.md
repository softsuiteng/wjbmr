Across-sectional study of congenital malaria was carried out at two different hospitals within Uyo metropolis;
St Lukeâ€™s Hospital, Anua and University of Uyo teaching Hospital, Uyo. A total number of 218 blood samples
were collected from the mothers and their new born babies and examined microscopically for malaria parasite
using both thick and thin films. The prevalence rate of congenital malaria obtained in this study was 12.8%.
The prevalence of placental, cord and maternal parasitaemia were 11.5% 12.4% and 3.7%, respectively.
Maternal genotypes were determined and it was observed that mothers with haemoglobin AAshowed a higher
rate of parasitaemia than AS. Plasmodium falciparium was the only species encountered in this study. Malaria
parasitaemia did not seem to have affected the faetal weight of the babies. A comparative analysis of the
relationship between congenital malaria and maternal, cord blood and placental parasitaemia as obtained
from this study, shows that placental parasitaemia had the highest prevalence (32.1%) of congenital malaria
(p>0.05) in Uyo. The use of intermittent prevention therapy prompt management of cases and insecticide
treated nets should be emphasized for all pregnant women.

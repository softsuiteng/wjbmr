Urinary tract disorders are usually asymptomatic in early stages, and may remain undetected until severe or
irreversible kidney damage has occurred. Dipstick urinalysis provides a simple cost effective way for screening
of urinary abnormalities, thus enabling early diagnosis and management of such disorders. The aim was to
determine the pattern of abnormal urinalysis and associated factors amongst asymptomatic adolescents in
Sokoto metropolis. Four hundred and twenty-six (426) students aged 10 to 18 years were selected through
multi-stage sampling in a descriptive cross sectional study from April to July 2014. Three hundred and ninetythree (92.3%) had their urine tested with dipstick test strips by Bayer, Plc. Their blood pressure, body mass
index and socioeconomic status were documented. There were 166 males and 227 females (M: F = 0.73:1).
Their mean age was 14.6 Â± 2.0 years. Abnormal urinary findings occurred in 117 (29.8%) of the subjects which
were proteinuria in 30 (7.6%), haematuria in 16 (4.1%), combined proteinuria/haematuria in 24 (6.1%),
nitrituria in 47 (12%), and leucocyturia in 12 (3.1%) subjects. The prevalence of urine abnormality was higher
in the 14-16 year age group though not statistically significant (p = 0.96). Proteinuria and nitrituria were
higher in females while hematuria was more in males (p = 0.16). All urine abnormalities were significantly
higher in the low socioeconomic class (p < 0.01). It was concluded that nitrituria and proteinuria were the
commonest abnormalities in adolescents in Sokoto metropolis. Also urine abnormalities were significantly
higher in subjects of low socioeconomic class.

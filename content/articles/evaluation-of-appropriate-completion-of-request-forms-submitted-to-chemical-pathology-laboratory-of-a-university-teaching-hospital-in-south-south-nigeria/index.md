Ordering of laboratory tests by physicians is a major component of the pre-analytical phase of the laboratory testing process (LTP). The most common medium of ordering for a biochemical test in the chemical pathology laboratory is by completing a laboratory request form (LRF). The main objective of this study was to review and evaluate the appropriate completion of LRFs submitted for biochemical analyses in the Chemical Pathology Laboratory of University of Calabar Teaching Hospital. The study involved a cross-sectional review of all completed LRFs submitted for biochemical tests in the chemical pathology laboratory of UCTH within a period of six (6) months. The appropriate completion of individual information (variables) contained in the request forms was examined for 1,630 patients. The
data obtained were recorded using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet prior to statistical analysis. Of the 1,630 LRFs reviewed and evaluated, none of them was completed adequately and accurately. Patient's name was filled in 99.8% of the forms followed in decreasing order by gender of patient (99.2%), examination required (99.0%) patient's age (97.5, laboratory number (96.8%) and specimen type (96.4%). The least commonly completed information were time of specimen collection (1.2%) and time of receipt of specimen (0.4%). Though the percentage completions of a good number of the items on the LRFs were appreciably high, not a single LRF had a 100% completion. This is a huge cause for concern because, a poorly completed LRF is a recipe for wrong interpretative comments, misleading diagnosis and inappropriate management of the patient.

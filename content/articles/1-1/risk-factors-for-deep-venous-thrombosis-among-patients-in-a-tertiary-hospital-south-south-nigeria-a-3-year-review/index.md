Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Prolonged immobilization in addition to other risk factors is known to be associated with increased risk of DVT. The objective of this study was to determine the risk factors and clinical manifestation of DVT among patients in University of Uyo Teaching Hospital (UUTH). Twenty three cases of Doppler ultrasound confirmed DVT seen at UUTH from January 2010 to December 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. Risk factors and clinical manifestations of DVT as documented in the patient's case notes at the time of diagnosis were recorded and analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 47.7 Â± 15.2. Male to female ratio was approximately 1:1. Advancing age greater than 40 years was the major risk factor for DVT (29.4%). Other risk identified occurred in variable proportion among the patients. The left lower limb was more commonly affected than the right (80%) ys 20%). Involvement of both common femoral and superficial femoral veins DVT was frequently encountered. Calf pain occurring alone or in combination with other clinical features was the commonest mode of presentation among the patients. A substantial risk for DVT exists in most surgical and medically ill patients. The clinical manifestations in majority of the cases are similar. We hereby recommend thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients unless otherwise contraindicated.

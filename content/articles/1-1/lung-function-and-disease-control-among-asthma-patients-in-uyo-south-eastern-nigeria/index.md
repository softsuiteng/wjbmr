Asthma is a complex condition with various markers of disease activity and control. Clinical manifestation, lung function and biomarkers of airway inflammation are some of the parameters used to evaluate disease activity. This study aimed to explore the correlation between clinical assessment of asthma control and lung function of Nigerians with bronchial asthma and therefore establish its value among our patients. To evaluate the association between clinical and physiologic manifestation of asthma, asthma patients underwent spirometry and answered the asthma control test (ACT) questionnaire. The study included 70 asthmatics: 54.3% were females while 45,7% were males. The average age of the patients was 46.8±18.1 years. The average ACT score was 14.4±4.8, 82.9% had poor control, 14% had good control while 2.9% had total control of asthma. The average forced expiratory volume in one second(FEV1) was 1.63±0.8L, the average forced vital capacity (FC)was 2.5±1.11, while the average FEFVC ratio was 0.67±0.22. The percentages of predicted lung volumes were 71.1±28.2% and 91.2±38.7% for FFV and FVC respectively. ACT scores correlated significantly with FEVI and percentage of predicted-FEAT. The CT is a simple tool for assessing asthma symptom control and the score is significantly associated with lung function among asthma patients in Nigeria. In the absence spirometry, ACT score may be useful in the pathophysiologic assessment of asthma control.

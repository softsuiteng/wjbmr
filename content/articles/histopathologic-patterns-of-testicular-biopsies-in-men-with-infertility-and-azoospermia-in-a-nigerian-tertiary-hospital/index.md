Infertility is a common public health problem worldwide. It is defined as inability to conceive after one
year of unprotected sexual intercourse. Investigations for male infertility include seminal fluid
analysis (SFA) and azoospermia is one of the abnormal findings. Testicular biopsy is frequently done
on such patients to unravel the testicular cause of infertility.The aim of this work was to study the
pattern of testicular histopathological findings in patients with azoospermia among men with
infertility in our facility. We retrospectively evaluated testicular histology reports of twelve (12) patients
between 2018 and 2020 who underwent bilateral testicular biopsy for azoospermia. Biodata of these
patients alongside with the type of infertility, duration of marriage was entered into a proforma
designed for this study. Patterns of histopathology were further scored using the modified Johnson
Scoring system and recorded. Data were entered into the statistical package for social science (SPSS)
version 20.0 software and analyzed. Mean age of patients was 39.75+6.122 years ranging from 34-
53years. Primary infertility predominated. Mean duration of marriage was 4.92 + 2.392 years ranging
th from 2 to 10 years. Men in their 4 decade of life formed the majority (58.3%). The most commonly
encountered histopathological pattern was seminiferous tubule hyalinization in 41.7% of the cases
with a modified Johnson Score of 1 dominating the picture (58.3%). Our patients were relatively young
with majority having poor prognostic testicular histologic pattern. This was also seen in both local and
international studies.

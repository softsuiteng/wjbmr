A case of massive obstetric haemorrhage, which could have resulted in maternal mortality, saves for timely intervention and availability of resources for emergency management of the patient is reported. The woman was a 36year old unbooked multipara who presented with intrapartum haemorrhage and hypertension, for which she was resuscitated and an emergency caesarean section performed on her. Following delivery, her condition deteriorated with signs of hypovolaemia and abdominal distension. She received blood transfusions and an exploratory laparotomy was performed on her, when she was found to have developed an extensive right broad ligament haematoma, which extended to the retroperitoneal space. The surgery became protracted and involved subtotal hysterectomy and insertion of a series of haemostatic stitches to control haemorrhage. Several units of blood were transfused with disseminated intravascular coagulation supervening. Eventually, haemostasis was achieved through an unconventional technique of applying local pressure at the operation field with sterile abdominal towels. She developed postoperative wound sepsis and dilated cardiomyopathy for which she was treated in addition. Massive obstetric haemorrhage, when associated with prolonged hypovolaemia as in this case could result in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy.

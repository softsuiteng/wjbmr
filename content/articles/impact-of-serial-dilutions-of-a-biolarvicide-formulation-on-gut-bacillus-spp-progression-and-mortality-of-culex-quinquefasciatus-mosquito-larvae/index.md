Conventional pesticides are the focal and mainstay tools being used in the control of mosquitoes. However,
some of these pesticides are known to cause acute and long term health problems in man. Moreso that they
constitute to the existing environmental pollution, there is therefore an urgent need to explore the effectiveness
of biolarvicides which is usually considered as a safe alternative to these conventional pesticides. A thorough
understanding of the fate and efficacy of biolarvicide formulations in mosquito breeding sites open to water
fluctuations is required for effective implementation of larval source management programmes. This study
investigated the colony progression and impact of Bacillus sp on the larval gut of Culex quinquefasciatus.
rd Twenty 3 instar larvae of C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were introduced into each of the three replicates of
-6 -7 -8 -9 ®
plastic beakers containing one litre of serial dilutions (1x10 , 1x10 , 1x 10 and 1 x10 ) of VectoMax CG
concentrations. Mean larval mortality of mosquitoes in each concentration was calculated hourly over a 24-
hour period. The concentration that induced 100% mortality under the shortest exposure period was chosen as
the dosage to be evaluated for its colony forming units in the larval gut exposed. Surface sterilization of
mosquito larvae and work space was carried out following standard techniques after which the mosquito guts
were dissected and plated on nutrient agar. Discrete colonies on each of the replicated plates were counted
using colony counter. The time taken to achieve 100% mortality of Culex quinquefasciatus after exposure to
-6 -7 -8 10 , 10 and 10 serial dilutions of the larvicides increased from 6-10 hours with an increasing dilution ratio.
-9 The least concentration of the microbial larvicide (10 ) induced 96 % mortality in the Culex population at 16
hours of exposure. The significant mean count of Bacillus sp found in the gut of Culex quinquefasciatus and
®
the lethal impact at reduced concentrations have shown that VectoMax CG could be a useful Larval Source
Management tool in habitat settings open to water fluctuations.

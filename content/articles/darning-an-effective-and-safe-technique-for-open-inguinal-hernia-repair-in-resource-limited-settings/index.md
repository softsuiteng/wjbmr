Current practice recommends the use of bio-prosthesis for inguinal hernia repair because of its low recurrence rates and ease of repair. These materials are expensive and not readily available to hernia surgeons practicing in low income countries. Alternative repair techniques are often employed for hernia repair in these countries. We assessed for the effectiveness of polypropylene darning technique as an alternative tension-free repair in fit young adults. Healthy adults in ASA I and II presenting with simple inguinal hernia were scheduled to undergo ambulatory two-layer polypropylene darn repair of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal and were followed for three years for evidence of pain, wound haematoma, wound infection, stitch sinus, bleeding or hernia recurrence. Seventy six repairs were done in 65 adult patients; 49 males and 16 females. Acute pain was complained of by 33 (50.6%), stitch sinus/granuloma by 6 (9.2%) and wound haematoma by 1 (1.5%) patient. No cases of wound infection or hernia recurrence were recorded in three years. Darning is an alternative, effective and safe tension-free technique for repairing the posterior wall of the inguinal canal in the absence of prosthetic bio-materials.

Evidence shows that low physical activity and poor eating habits in adolescents may establish behavioural patterns that will predispose them to increased chronic disease risk in adulthood. Documenting the adolescents' nutritional knowledge, physical activity and eating behaviour is an important prerequisite for designing and implementing, required nutrition education intervention. The objective of the study was to assess the nutritional knowledge, physical activity and eating behaviour of adolescents in public schools in Uyo. A structured questionnaire and a good frequency questionnaire were used to elicit socio demographic information and nutrition knowledge and behaviour of the respondents. Results showed that there was poor nutrition knowledge regarding causes of overweight/obesityand their health implication (62.1% and 38.5% respectively). About 36%had poor knowledge of causes and health implication of under-nutrition.Female were physically more active than male (P=0.048), mothers' qualification was also strongly associated with physical activity (p=0.044). Ahigh number of respondents consumed highly processed snacks more than 5times a week; the females significantly consumed more snacks than male; mineral(p value < 0.0001) ice cream (p value<0.0001), egg rolls (p value=0.025). While only 27.3% consumed fruit and moi-moi more than 5 times per week. About 20% of respondents skipped breakfast 1-4times/week. While 23.6 % skipped more than 4 times per week, the common reason for skipping breakfast was “not hungry,” (54.8%).There is an urgent need to include nutrition education in the curriculum at all levels of schooling and in a way that it will positively impact in prevention of diet related chronic-non-communicable diseases.

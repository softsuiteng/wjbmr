Group B Streptococcal (GBS) colonization causes asymptomatic bacteriuria or urinary tract infection 
in pregnancy. Pregnant women who are GBS carriers have the potential of transmitting the organism 
to their new-born infants which causes sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis. This study was undertaken 
to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic Group B Streptococcal bacteriuria among pregnant 
women attending antenatal clinics. A total of 160 clean catch mid-stream urine samples from 
consenting pregnant women were processed and analysed using cultural, morphological, biochemical 
and serological assay for detection and confirmation of GBS. Socio-demographic information such as 
the patients' age, gestation, sexual behaviour, education, type of residence, occupation and clinical 
data were obtained using questionnaires, in other to analyse possible risk factors for GBS. Antibiotic 
sensitivity pattern of GBS isolates was determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards 
Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Out of the 160 pregnant subjects, 5(3.1 %) had GBS bacteriuria. There 
was no statistically significant association between GBS colonization and the socio-demographic risk 
factors analysed (p > 0.05). Antibiotic susceptibility test revealed that GBS exhibited 20 %, 80 %, 20 % 
and 60 % susceptibility to Penicillin, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Ertapenem respectively. This 
study showed that GBS colonizes genitourinary tract in pregnant women. Although Penicillin is the 
recommended drug for treatment, this study showed a reduced susceptibility of GBS to Penicillin. It is 
therefore recommended that screening for GBS bacteriuria in pregnant women and proper treatment 
should be considered an essential part of antenatal care in the clinics in this region.

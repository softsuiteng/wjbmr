A convenience sample of 375 newly tested HIV-seropositivity patients at the HIV Clinic, University of Uyo Teaching Hospital were assessed for coping strategies and the levels of stress at two points in time four weeks apart using COPE and Perceived stress Questionnaires(PSQ).The mean age for males was 37.8±3.9 and females 29.2±1.7. Stress levels were less in respondents using adaptive coping strtegies such as social supports mean score: 9.7±1.2 first assessment and 4.9±2.1 second(t=1.71; p=0.001); religion 8.5±1.2/ 5.1±2.1 (t=2.43; p=0.664); humour 11.8±2.1/6.3±1.2 (t=1.11; p=0.485). The levels were increased in denial mean score: 13.5±2.1/17.5±2.2  (t=4.09; p=0.001); suppression of competing activites 8.4±1.8/9.9 ±2.1 (t=.705; p=0.545); restraint 4.9±1.0/6.5±1.3(t=3.41; p=0.110); planning 9.1±41.4/11.3±2.6(t=2.33; p=0.532); self-distraction 9.1±2.7/9.9±2.0 (t=.376; p=0.065) and behavioural disengagement 8.3±1.0/9.2±1.8 (t=1.07; p=0.280). Adaptive coping strategies were negatively correlated with levels of stress (r=0.415, p=0.001). This study suggests that strengthening and promoting adequate coping strategies in people living with HIV/AIDS may serve as effective strategies for improving the psychological well-being and quality of life.

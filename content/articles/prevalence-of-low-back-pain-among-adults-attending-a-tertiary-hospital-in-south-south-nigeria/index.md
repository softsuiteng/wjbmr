Low back pain is the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorder and a common cause of disability. It is a considerable health problem affecting people in the developing and developed countries. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of low back pain among adult patients seeking medical care at the General outpatient department of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Uyo, South-South Nigeria. This was a cross-sectional study of 400 subjects aged 18years and above selected by systematic random sampling technique, from the month of May 2011 to July 2011. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-demographic characteristics and the presence or absence of low back pain in the subjects. Data obtained was analyzed using Epi info statistical software version 3.2.2. One hundred and seventy –six (44%) male and Two hundred and twenty-four (56%) female subjects participated in the study (male : female; 1:1.3). The point prevalence of low back pain in the subjects was 31.0%. The prevalence was higher among the male 2 (34.7%) than the female (28.1%) subjects(X²=1.97, P =0.16).The prevalence of low back pain in this study is high and comparable to that obtained in other studies within and outside Nigeria. Health education on the prevention of low back pain should be encouraged.

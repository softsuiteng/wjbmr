HIVrelated stigma and discrimination take different forms and are manifested at different levels and context in the society including the health care set up. This study was conducted to examine Knowledge, Attitude and Perception of Doctors and Nurses in Public and Private Health Facilities in relation to stigma and discrimination towards People Living with HIV in Maiduguri-Nigeria. Astructured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on knowledge, attitudes and personal risk perception of HIV/AIDS and related issues among doctors and nurses in private and public health facilities. Findings from this study showed that majority (>70%) of the healthcare workers across the facilities demonstrated good knowledge of HIV/AIDS except   <20% that believed that HIV could be transmitted through hand shaking and sharing of towels and clothing. On capacity building through training, more doctors in tertiary health facilities (71.7%) when compared to their counterparts in secondary (66.7%) and private (40.0%) facilities had been trained on HIV/AIDS-related services. This observation was similar for nurses. Some nurses (10 7%) and doctors (15.2%) in the tertiary health facilities expressed fear of contracting HIV while attending to PLWH while only a few doctors (6.5%) and nurses (3.6%) in the tertiary health facility, and 16% of nurses in private hospitals admitted to have denied or refused HIVservices to PLWH. Less than 50% of doctors and nurses in all the health facilities admitted being overstretched, stressed and suffered burn-out while managing HIV-related cases because of shortage of trained staff. Self-risk perception among the respondents was generally high especially the aspect of recapping used needles and handling of patient blood samples except for some respondents in the private facilities. Majority of doctors (60%) and nurses (92%) in the private facilities indicated adequacy of disposable hand gloves and infection prevention tools at all times contrary to experiences in the public facilities where >50% of all the respondents attested to inadequacy. Relevant trainings and special attention to health workers' needs are key to a successful HIV/AIDS programming and reduction of stigma and discrimination among health care workers in Maiduguri, Nigeria

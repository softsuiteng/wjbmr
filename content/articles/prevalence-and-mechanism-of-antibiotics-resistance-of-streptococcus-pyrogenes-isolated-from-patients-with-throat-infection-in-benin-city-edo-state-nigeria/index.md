streptococcus pyogenes are gram-positive bacterian which causes a wide variety of clinical manifestations include pharyngitis.Penicillin is the preferred treatment but in cases of penicilin allergy or therapy failure, macrolides are considered as an alternative. However, macrolide resistance has become a problem in many countries. this study was aimed to determine the prevalence and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of S.pyogenes in Benin city, Edo state, Nigeria. A total of 197 throat swabs were collected from patients(aged 2-63 years) aseptically and innoculated on blood agar and incubated at 37C for 20 hours. S.pyogenes isolates were identified by bacitracin susceptibility and latex agglutination tests and subsequently antibiotics susceptibility was done using Kirby Bauer method. The presence of the macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype was then tested on macrolide resistant isolates using D-zone test. Out of the total of 197 throat swabs obtained,19(9.6%) were confirmed as S.pyogenes, of which 11(57.89%) and 8(42.11%) were from males and females respectively. The susceptibility test revealed that all isolates were susceptible to penicillin, cefriaxone, Vancomycin, Levoflaxacin, linezolid and chloramphenicol. Erythromycin resistance was found in 4(21.05%) of the GAS isolates, out of which 3(75%)expressed the iMLSB phenotype and 1(25%),the M phenotype. Inducible clindamycin resistance was observed in 3(15.79%)isolates. The prevalence of S.pyogenes in the study population was 9.65%, with the peak incidence found in children aged 8-13 years.

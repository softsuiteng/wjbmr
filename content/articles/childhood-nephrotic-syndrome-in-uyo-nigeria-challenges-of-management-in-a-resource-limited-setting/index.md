Childhood nephrotic syndrome is a common glomerular disorder with massive proteinuria. Interplay of sociodemographic factors, variation in clinical presentation, steroid responsiveness and access to steroid-sparing
therapy has remarkable impact on its outcome. The presentation and management outcome of nephrotic
syndrome in a resource limited setting were reviewed. Data was obtained from the renal register of the
paediatric renal unit of University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Uyo, Nigeria from January 2007 to December
2016. Fifty-five children aged 9 months to 17 years with a mean age of 10.1±4.7 years formed the study
population. Peak age was 14-15 years with a gender distribution of 36 males (65.5%) and 19 females (34.5%)
giving a M:F ratio of 1.9:1. Sixty percent of the patients belonged to the low socio-economic class. Significant
clinical features were: generalised oedema (94.5%), hypertension (67.3%), oliguria (65.5%) and microscopic
haematuria (50.9%). Complications included pulmonary oedema and encephalopathy (9.1% each), severe
anaemia (5.5%) and primary peritonitis (2.6%). Serum creatinine could be done in 89.1% and estimated
2
glomerular filtration rates were as low as £15mls/1.73m /min in 10.9% of the patients. Possible secondary
aetiologies were Hepatitis B and C {(6/34) 17.6%} and {(4/34) 11.8%} respectively), sickle cell anaemia {(3/20)
15%} and human immunodeficiency virus {(2/35) 5.7%}. Renal biopsy was indicated in all the 17 steroid
resistant patients but was not affordable. Overall, favourable steroid response (remission) was documented
within 7-42 days in 21 (38.2%)of the patients and 17 (30.9%) were steroid resistant. The remaining 17 (30.9%)
did not continue long enough in care to ascertain their response to steroid therapy. Further remission with
cyclophosphamide occurred in 7/17 (41.2%) of the steroid resistant group. Thirteen patients (23.6%) of the
total study population required renal replacement therapy. Only 5/13 (38.5%) could afford between two and
eight sessions of haemodialysis, out of which 2/5 (40%) recovered renal functions. Financial constraint was a
prominent factor in the poor outcome of our study population. Subsidised treatment of childhood nephrotic
syndrome in our locale is therefore recommended.

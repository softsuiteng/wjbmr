This study draws attention to the increasing prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) MRSAin Mubi
especially those mediated by mecA. The use of Cefoxitin disc diffusion test as a suitable substitute
procedure for the detection of mecA-mediated Methicillin resistance has been widely reported and
accepted. A standard procedure was used for both the isolation and identification of Staphylococcus
aureus and the phenotypic screening of Methicillin-resistant strains. Most of the MRSA was isolated
from semen, wound swab and high vaginal swab. Of the 34 isolated S. aureus, 32(94.1%) and
22(64.7%) were found to be Methicillin-resistant (MRSA) by Oxacillin and Cefoxitin disc diffusion test
respectively. Out of the 12 S. aureus susceptible to Cefoxitin, two were also susceptible to Oxacillin
while 10 were resistant to Oxacillin. The resistance pattern of MRSA revealed that MRSA was mostly
resistant to Norfloxacin 18(81.8%), followed by Ampiclox 16(72.7%), Amoxicillin 15(68.2%) and the
least resistance was recorded on Levofloxacin and Ciprofloxacin 6(27.3%) each. Most of the MRSA
also exhibited multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotype. Oxacillin disc diffusion test overestimated
MRSA when compared with Cefoxitin disc diffusion test. More so, the high prevalence of MRSA
coupled with MDR phenotype in this study is worrisome.

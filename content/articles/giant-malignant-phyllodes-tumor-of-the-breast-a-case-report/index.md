Phyllodes tumors are rare fibro-epithelial lesions that account for about 0.3% to 0.9% of female breast tumors.
The tumors could be classified into benign, borderline, and malignant lesions based on the histological
features. The malignant types represent only about 10 to 30% of these tumors. These tumours could grow
rapidly to giant sizes when mastectomy would be required for adequate tumor free margin to be achieved. The
patient should be closely followed up for possible recurrence. We report a case of malignant phyllodes tumor in
a 38 year old female who presented with left breast lump of 18 years duration with sudden increase in size 6
months prior to presentation, and ulceration. Examination revealed a huge ulcerated mass involving the entire
left breast, measuring 24cm x 20cm in size with no axillary lymph node enlargement. The contralateral breast
and axilla showed normal features. In cisional biopsy and histology suggested malignant phyllodes tumor.
Total mastectomy was done. Postoperatively, she received cyclical Adriamycin and Ifosfamide chemotherapy.
She has undergone follow up to sixth months.

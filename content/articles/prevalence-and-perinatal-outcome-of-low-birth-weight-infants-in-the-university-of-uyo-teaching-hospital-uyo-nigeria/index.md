Low birth weight (LBWs) deliveries constitute significantly to the disproportionately high neonatal and infant mortality rates in the developing world as well as mental, physical and neurological handicaps later in life.The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and perinatal outcomes of low birth weight babies in the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital from January 2006 to December 2007.The incidence of low birth weight babies was 12.3%. This was higher among female babies 53.7%, preterm deliveries (62.1%) and nulliparous mothers (35.1%). There were statistically significant associations in the number of still births (p<0.0001), caesarean sections rates (p<0.001), perinatal admissions and deaths (p<0.001)among these babies when compared with babies of normal weight. There was however a statistically significant better birth outcome among LBWs weighing above 1.5kg when compared to those = 1.5kg.

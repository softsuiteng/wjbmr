Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) was once thought to be rare among Africans when compared with their Caucasian counterparts. Recent studies have however shown an increasing incidence among Africans with a predilection for younger patients aged 40 years or below. The objective of this study was to determine the age and sex distribution of patients, as well as the clinical and pathological characteristics colorectal carcinoma among those patients in Lagos, South-West Nigeria. A retrospective review of all haematoxylin and eosin stained slides of CRC diagnosed in the department between January 1997 and December 2006 was carried out. The demographic data and clinical information of the patients were extracted from their case notes. Out of a total of 1954 malignancies, 170 cases were colorectal carcinoma, accounting for 8.7% of all malignancies diagnosed during the 10 year study period. Colorectal carcinoma also accounted for 68.8% of all gastrointestinal tract cancers during the study period. The ages of the patients ranged from 15 to 81 years, with a mean age of 50.8+14.3 years. The peak age-group of diagnosis of CRC among the patients was 51-60 years, with a male to female ratio of 1.4:1.0. The rectum was the commonest site of colorectal carcinoma accounting for $2.2% of cases. Right-sided colonic carcinomas were commoner (80.0%) among patients aged 40 years or younger; whereas it accounted for 65.3% of patients aged above 40 years. Adenocarcinoma was the most common (79.8%) histological type found among patients in the study population. Out of the 23 cases of mucinous carcinomas, 69.6% occurred among patients aged 40 years or younger, as against 30.4% of cases, which occurred among older patients aged above 40 years. This study has revealed that adenocarcinoma was the predominant histological type of colorectal carcinoma among patients in the study population. Mucinous carcinoma and right-sided colon carcinoma were commoner among patients aged 40 years or younger.

Enterococci are commensal bacteria that can cause life threatening infections in debilitated and immunocompromised patients. This study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of enterococcal isolates colonizing hospitalized patients in Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Lagos, Nigeria. Ninety-two enterococcal isolates were tested by the E-test MIC method against Vancomycin, Teicoplanin, Ampicillin, Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin. One percent (1%) were resistant to Vancomycin, 0% to Teicoplanin and Linezolid, 20.7% to Ampicillin, 58.7% to Ciprofloxacin, and 38% exhibited high level resistance to Gentamicin. Antimicrobial stewardship measures are required to preserve the efficacy of currently available antimicrobial agents.

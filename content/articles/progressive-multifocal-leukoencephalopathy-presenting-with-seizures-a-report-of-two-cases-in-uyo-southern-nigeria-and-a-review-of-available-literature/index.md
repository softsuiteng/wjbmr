Progressive multifocal leuko-encephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic infection of the central nervous system that occurs almost exclusively in the setting of immunosuppression. It is a fatal demyelinating disease caused by the polyoma JC virus that commonly presents with impaired vision, mental changes and motor weakness. Seizures are a rare presentation. We report two cases that presented with seizures. This to the best of our knowledge is the first report in Africa. We report the cases of two women ages thirty five and twenty three years respectively who presented with seizures. The first woman had left sided seizures, loss of consciousness with associated weakness of the left side of the body. She had been HIV positive for five years but had not commenced HAART. The second patient presented with frequent seizures which was preceded by headaches and loss of consciousness. She had been diagnosed HIV positive only a week earlier but had a history of weight loss and nonspecific headaches for one year duration. Brain CT scan showed features consistent with PML in both cases. PML is not a rare disease in HIV patients. The presentation however may be unusual as described in these two patients. There is need for a high index of suspicion. The acquisition of modern imaging modalities has contributed immensely to increased diagnosis of cases.

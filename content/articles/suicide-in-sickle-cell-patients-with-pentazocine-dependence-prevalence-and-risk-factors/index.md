Chronic disease and substance addiction each acting singly can increase the risk of suicide beyond that of the general population. Nigeria is recorded as having the largest depot of sickle cell disease (chronic disease) in the world and also has a significant number of substance addicts. The aim of this study was to find out the prevalence of the risk of suicide in a pentazocine dependent sickle cell population particularly as sickle cell disease is already a public health burden in Nigeria as well as to identify the risk factors for suicide.The study was conducted amongst sickle cell patients attending the out-patient department of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, using a structured questionnaire comprising a section on social demographic data and ICD 10 diagnostic criteria in addition to a sheet that elicited information on suicidal thoughts and attempts, emotional feeling state, etc. One Hundred and Sixty Eight (168) patients were recruited by purposive sampling method over a one week period but only 125 successfully completed the questionnaire to meet the basic requirement for analysis. Those who were too ill or showed reluctance despite assurances of confidentiality were excluded. Participants were aged 18 to 45 years. They were largely in the 18 30 year age group 100 (80%) and had a preponderance of male 68 (54.4%) over females 57 (45.6%). Educational status, tertiary education 49 (39.2%), secondary 41 (32.8%), primary 13 (10.4%), no formal education 22 (17.6%). Thirty One (24.8%) of the total population of 125 met with the diagnostic criteria for dependence syndrome. Suicidal ideation in this population was 19.5%, attempted suicide 9.6%, as against 2.9% in the general population and 8% in sickle cell population without substance addiction problem. Sad mood was present in 22 (71%) of the respondents, stigma 16 (51.5%) and hostile attitude 12 (38.7%). Pentazocine addiction may have conferred the slightly higher rate of suicidal attempts on patients with sickle cell disease.

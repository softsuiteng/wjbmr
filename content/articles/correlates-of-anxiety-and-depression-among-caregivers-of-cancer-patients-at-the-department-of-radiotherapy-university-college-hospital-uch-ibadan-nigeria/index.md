There is a near absence of studies on psychological morbidities among cancer informal caregivers in Nigeria.
Consequently, this study was carried out to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression (and the
variables associated with them) among caregivers of cancer patients at the University College Hospital,
Ibadan, Nigeria. The study also investigated out the socio-demographic and characteristics of the caregivers.
One hundred and thirty five consecutive caregivers attending the Radiotherapy Clinic completed
questionnaires after ethical approval was obtained from the Joint Ethical Review Committee of the University
of Ibadan/University College Hospital, Ibadan. Data was collected using a questionnaire that consisted of
socio-demographic and other variables of caregivers and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The
mean age of the participants was 45 years while the age range was 22-76 years. The prevalence rate of
depression was 50.7% while that of anxiety was 40.0%. One hundred and seventeen (86.7%) of them had
helper to support with care giving and almost all (94.1%) of them were concern about the cost of treatment.
Ninety six (71.1%) enjoyed financial support from family members. More than three quarters of the
participants reported their care receivers' functioning to be fair to very good. Age above 40 years, fear of
having to carry on with care much longer and absence of feeling that care receiver is not getting proper
treatment significantly differentiated caregivers who had depression and anxiety from those that did not have.
The high prevalence rates of depression and anxiety may constitute a major setback for management of cancer
patients as caregivers need to enjoy mental health to be able to play their roles.

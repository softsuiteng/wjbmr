Human Parvovirus B19 is a small single stranded positive sense DNA virus, from the family Parvoviridae,
genus Erythrovirus and Human Parvovirus B19 type species, causing transient aplastic crises in sickle cell
disease patient. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of Parvovirus B19 in sickle cell anaemia
patients in selected hospitals in Kano metropolis. A total of 90 participants with sickle cell disease were recruited
for the study in four main hospitals in Kano metropolis; Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital, Aminu Kano
Teaching Hospital, Hasiya Bayero Paediatrics Hospital and Abdullahi Wase Specialist Hospital and the sociodemographic factors were recorded using structured questionnaire. Parvovirus B19 antigen was assayed using
Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay kit (Melsin Medical Co., Limited). Data was analyzed using SPSS
version 20.0. The prevalence of Human Parvovirus B19 antigen from the study subjects was 2 (2.2%). The
positive subjects were found to be all males. It showed that the virus is in circulation among the study subjects
which prompt the need for a large scale community based study to ascertain the burden of the virus in the study
area.

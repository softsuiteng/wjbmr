Turning waste to value is trending issue of global importance, and Musa sapientum (Banana) peels are mostly
discarded as waste, however spotted peels have been reported to possess rich antioxidants; this study
investigated ethanolic extracts of Musa sapientum green, yellow and spotted peels treatment on the kidney
histology and renal function parameters following carbontetrachloride (CCl ) exposure in male Wistar rats. 50 4
rats (180 - 220g) divided into 10 groups (I - X) of 5 rats per group: Groups I (normal control), Groups (II, IV, V,
VI, VII, VIII, IX and X) was injected with CCl intraperitoneally. III (vehicle) received 10% of tween 80 and 4
olive oil. IV and V received 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight yellow peels extract, VI and VII received 500 and
1000 mg/kg body weight green peels extract, VIII and IX were administered 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight
spotted peels extract, while X received vitamin C 300 mg/kg body weight. Administration was for 21 days.
Results showed significant (p<0.05) increase in creatinine and urea concentrations in CCl -exposed group 4
+ compared with control and treated groups, also there were significant (p<0.05) increase in K concentration in
CCl -induced group and in groups that received the different peels ethanolic extract at 1000 mg/kg when 4
compared with control. Histology revealed severe distortions in renal tubes, glomerulus and occlusion of
urinary space in CCl -exposed group compared to control and treated groups. However there were marked 4
nephro-protection in groups IX and X. In conclusion, ethanolic extract spotted peels of Musa sapientum
through its antioxidants activity better ameliorates against CCl -induced nephrotoxicity in a dose-dependent 4
concentration than the green and yellow peels.

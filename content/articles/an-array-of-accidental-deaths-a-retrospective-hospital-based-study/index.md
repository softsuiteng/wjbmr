Burns, choking from foreign body aspiration; fall from height and drowning accounted for 23.4%, 0.9%, 0.3% and 0.3% of cases respectively in decreasing order of frequency. More males (72%) died unintentionally and the majority of deaths fell within the young age group (20-39 years). RTA accounted for most cases of accidental deaths. Others were burns, choking

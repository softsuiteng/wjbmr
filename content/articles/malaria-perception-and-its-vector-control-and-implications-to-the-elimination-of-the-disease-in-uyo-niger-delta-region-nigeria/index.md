Malaria remains the greatest threat to survival for young African children and pregnant women who are at greater risk of severe malaria. The potential contribution of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) studies to malaria research and control has not received much attention and application in Uyo Local Government Area (LGA) in particular, and the Niger-Delta Region of Nigeria, in general. This study investigated the local community understanding of malaria transmission, perceptions of cause, preventive measures and practices in order to inform the country's proposed malaria elimination programme in Akwa Ibom State. Simple random multi-stage sampling technique was employed for the research survey. The data collection instruments were structured and systematically drawn questionnaires as well as personal interviews. A total of 400 randomly selected individuals were interviewed using qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were analysed using SPSS Version 17.0. Perception of malaria as a major health problem by the sampled population was quite high (85.25%), and so also was the understanding of the respondents concerning the cause of malaria (80.50%), which they attributed to mosquito bites. Other respondents (19.50%) attributed it to many other causes but the causation/transmission model of people differed from biomedical facts. The perceived factors responsible for the spread of malaria were: dirty environment (41.25%), standing water puddle (39.50%), thick forest (7.25%), seasonal changes (4.25%) while a combination of two or more factors accounted for about 7.75% Knowledge about causes and transmission of malaria in Uyo LGA is still shrouded in a lot of misconceptions. This study advocates the promotion. acquisition, effective utilization and sustenance of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) as a barrier to the nuisance caused by mosquitoes and other insects of public health importance. Health education, advocacy, awareness creation, motivation and mobilization of the endemic communities to be involved in the malaria elimination programme are highly recommended.

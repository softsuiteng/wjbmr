Fresh and dried leaves of Ocimum gratissimum are used traditionally in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria for
treatment of some infectious diseases but information on the antibacterial potency of one leaf form over the
other is very little. The study analyzed the phytochemical composition and antibacterial properties of crude
extracts of fresh and dried leaves of O.gratissimum on some clinical isolates. The phytochemical and
antibacterial properties of crude extracts of O. gratissimum were determined using standard techniques. The
concentration of crude extracts of cold water and ethanol of fresh and dried leaves varied from 100mg/ml -
250mgl/ml. Susceptibility assay was conducted using agar -disc diffusion and Gentamicin (GEN) was
included as a control antimicrobial agent. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each extract form was
determined. Clinical isolates used in the study were: Salmonella species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella species. The phytochemical compositions of the plant include
tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins and anthraquinone. High antibacterial activities was observed with
cold water fresh leaves (CWFL) extract exhibiting zones of inhibition (Z.I) of 18±0.13mmfor both Salmonella
spp and S. aureus at the concentration of 250mg/ml. The ethanol extract of the fresh leaves (ETFL) had varied
Z.I that ranged from 12±0.55mm - 18±0.16mm on the E.coli, S. aureus and Klebsiella organisms.. The cold
water dried leaves (CWDL) extract exhibited either lower Z.I or no zones of inhibition (N.Z) for Salmonella
species, S. aureus and S.pyogenes while ethanolic dried leaves (ETDL) extracts had smaller Z.I in the range of
8±0.32mm -15±0.20mm for Salmonella spp and S. aureus. The values were comparable with GEN having Z.I
between 16±0.16mm - 20±1.25mmfor the test organisms. Low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
values of 6.25mg/ml were recorded with CWFL and ETFL extracts for isolates E.coli, Streptococcus pyogenes
Klebsiella spp than other forms of extracts. These findings provide evidence that fresh leaves of
Ocimumgratissimum have higher degree of antibacterial efficacy with some clinical isolates.

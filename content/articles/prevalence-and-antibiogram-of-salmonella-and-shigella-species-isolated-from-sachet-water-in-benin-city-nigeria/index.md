Enteric pathogens in portable water constitute a major health problem in developing countries like Nigeria.
This study reports the prevalence and antibiotic resistance profile of Salmonella and Shigella species in sachet
water sold in Benin City, Nigeria. Sixty randomly selected sachet water samples were cultured and identified
biochemically for Salmonella and Shigella spp. and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing. Fifty-one
enteric isolates comprising of 24 Salmonella spp. and 27 Shigella spp were found. There was no significant
difference (P= 0.641) in their occurrence. Both exhibited multiple antibiotic resistances (MAR) against the
tested antibiotics. Salmonella spp. were more resistant to cephalexin (91.7%) and nalixidic acid (75%), while
Shigella spp. were more resistant to cephalexin and streptomycin (74.1%). The resistance profile of Salmonella
spp. was not significantly different from that of Shigella spp (P = 0.172). Ten resistant patterns were
demonstrated by both organisms with MAR Index range of 0.1-0.7 (for Salmonella spp) and 0.1-0.9 (for
Shigella spp). The MAR index of both organisms showed no significant difference (P = 0.892). The dominant
resistance phenotype for Salmonella spp was pef, cep, ofx, na, gen, str and cep, ofx, amc, na, amp, sxt with 4
Salmonella isolates each. Whereas, that for Shigella spp was Pef, cep, cpx, amp, ofx, gen, na, sxt, str with 6
Shigella isolates. Most sachet water available in this metropolis is therefore also a bag of antibiotic resistant
organisms. Public health measures are highly required to determine and prevent further contamination of
sachet water.

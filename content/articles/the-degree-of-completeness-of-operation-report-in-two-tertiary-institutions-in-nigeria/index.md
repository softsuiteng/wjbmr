The operation report documents the intra- and post-operative surgical events; it easily communicates these
events between clinicians. The quality of this report depends on its completeness and clarity. These reports
serve as tools for further decision making, quality assurance, patient outcomes research and also have medicolegal implications. To assess the degree of completion of operation notes in two tertiary hospitals in Nigeria, we
reviewed operative reports daily over twelve weeks, checking for degree of completion of individual fields.
Twelve fields considered important were extracted from our report format and validated as essential by two
general surgeons from both institutions and accepted by members in the study group. These fields were checked
in each report to determine the degree of completion of the write-up. Data analysis was done with SPSS 17 for
Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois) and reported as simple percentages. Atotal of 245operative reports were
reviewed, involving 123 (50.2%) elective procedures; 11 (4.5%) did not specify the class of procedure (elective
or emergency). Consultants undertook 50% of the procedures while trainees made the write-up in 212 (86.5%).
No field was 100% complete. The drain (39%) and pack (47.8%) fields recorded the worst completion rate. Type
of skin closure (60%), operations details (72.2%), blood loss (62.9%), and post-operative orders (73.9%) were
low. There is compelling need for improving the technical quality of operative reports in our practice. Surgeons
must teach and supervise their trainees on techniques of operations report writing to prevent avoidable
litigations.

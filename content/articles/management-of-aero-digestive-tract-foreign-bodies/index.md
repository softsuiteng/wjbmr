Aerodigestive tract foreign bodies (FBs) are commonly encountered in medical practice. Presentation could be as elective or life-threatening emergency. Management can be difficult in some cases. The study aims to evaluate institutional experience with the management of aerodigestive tract FBs. Retrospective records of patients who were managed for aerodigestive tract FBs in our hospital between 2008 and 2018 were collated. Extracted data were entered into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using STATA version 10. Two hundred and twenty-three patients were treated for aerodigestive tract FBs during the study period with male: female (M:F) ratio 1:1.1, age range 6 months to 71years and median age of 3 years. There were 59(26.5%) FBs in the digestive tract and 164 (73.5%) FBs in the airway. Common modes of presentations include respiratory distress among patients presenting with foreign body in the airway and dysphagia and odynophagia in those with impacted oesophageal foreign body. Diagnosis and localisation of lower airway FBs were with plain radiograph and occasionally computed tomography while impacted oesophageal dentures were
confirmed with dilute barium contrast oesophagogram and rigid oesophagoscopy. All but one FBs were removed, with majority (95%) being via endoscopy. Mortality rate was low (0.45%). The patients in this study presented more commonly with foreign bodies in the airway especially in the paediatric age group. With timely diagnosis and therapeutic interventions including endoscopy and selected open surgeries, successful removal can be achieved with very low mortality.

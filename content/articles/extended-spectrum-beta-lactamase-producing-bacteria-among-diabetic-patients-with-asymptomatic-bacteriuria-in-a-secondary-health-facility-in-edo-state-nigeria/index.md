Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) can increase the risk for developing symptomatic urinary tract infection
(UTI) and diabetes mellitus is one of the high risk medical condition for ASB. This study was carried out to
determine the prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria in diabetic patients
attending Central Hospital, Benin City. The descriptive cross-sectional study design was adopted for this study,
while data was obtained with the use of a structured questionnaire administered on 695 consented diabetic
Â®
patients. Statistical analysis was done using the statistical software INSTAT (Graph Pad Software Inc., La
Jolla, CA, USA). Mid-stream urine samples were aseptically collected from these patients, processed and
analysed using standard techniques. Identification of bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility testing
were carried out using standard microbiological techniques. ESBL-producers were detected using appropriate
phenotypic method. A total of 253(36.4%) patients were culture positive with Escherichia coli being the most
predominant organism (37.5%). Proteus mirabilis was the highest ESBL producer and was statistically
significant (50.0%) (p=0.0095). Uncontrolled glycaemia was associated with ESBL-production among
bacterial isolates (P=0.0129). Age, gender and source of clinical isolates did not significantly affect ESBL
production by the isolated uropathogenic bacteria (P >0.05).The prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria
among diabetic patients having ASB was 36.8%. Adherence to proper and effective antimicrobial regimen and
laboratory guidance in treatment of ASB among diabetic patients are recommended.

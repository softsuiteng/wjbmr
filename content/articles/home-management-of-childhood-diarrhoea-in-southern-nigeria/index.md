Diarrhoea is a major public health problem and the second leading cause of under-five mortality globally. Low osmolality oral rehydration solution and Zinc tablets are critical components of the World Health Organization (WHO) treatment guidelines for the home management of childhood diarrhoea. The study was conducted among caregivers of under-fives admitted in the Children's Emergency Unit (CHEU) of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital (UUTH). A validated semistructured proforma was used to collect relevant information relating to the home management of diarrhoea by their caregivers. The data obtained were entered and analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2007. The children's characteristics were described using frequencies and percentages. Significance test was done using Chi-square test which was deemed statistically significant if p value was < 0.05. A total of 100 caregivers were enrolled into the study. Home fluid was used by 59 caregivers (59.0%) in the management of childhood diarrhoea. The fluids commonly used were Oral rehydration solution (ORS) alone by 31(31.0%), salt sugar solution (SSS) by 16(16.0%) and ORS with Zinc tablet by 9(9.0%).
Of the 59 caregivers that used home fluids, 41(68.5%) gave less amount of fluid while 15(25.4%) gave more fluid. The use of ORS was significantly associated with high social class (p = 0.025). Antibiotics, analgesics, and local enema were the frequently used medications. The home management of childhood diarrhoea in this study was generally sub-optimal. Only about one-tenth of caregivers gave low osmolality ORS with Zinc tablets supplementation as recommended by WHO.

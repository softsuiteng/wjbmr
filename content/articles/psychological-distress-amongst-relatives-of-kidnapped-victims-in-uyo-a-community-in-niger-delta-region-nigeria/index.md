There is a growing concern about the increasing incidence of kidnapping in Nigeria. However, data of its impacts on victims and family members are scarce. This study assesses the psychological wellbeing of victims in Uyo, a community in Niger Delta Region, Nigeria, to monitor their life changes. Between January 2009 and 2011, a purposive sample of 37 relatives of kidnapped victims, who accompanied the victims to the Psychiatric clinic of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, were screened for psychological indices four weeks after the incidence, using Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and Clinician Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale (CAPS). Twenty four (64.9%) relatives were males and 13 (35.1%) females. The mean age for males was 55±5.7 years and females 43±13.1. The mean score for entire sample for males on WHO-5 Well-Being Index was 11.5±13.21 and 9.7±1.3 for females (p=0.023); on RSE Scale, 7.89±2.12 for males and 8.3±2.01 for females (p=0.001); and on the CAPS, 44.3±1.33 for males and 41.5±3.01 females (p=0.619): 5 (13.5%) females and 1 (2.7%) met the criteria for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The total severity scores for the females were 83 and 71 for the males. An inference from this study is that relatives of kidnapped victims are prone to developing psychological distress as well. Therefore, they must always be included in the management plan of the victims.

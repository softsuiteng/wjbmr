Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the surgical gold standard in the management of benign
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). To evaluate the feasibility of spinal anaesthesia for TURP. This was a descriptive
observational prospective study performed in six patients who underwent TURP under spinal anaesthesia
th th between 24 -25 September 2015, at the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Uyo, Nigeria. All patients
received spinal anaesthesia in the sitting position. Patients' variable were monitored throughout the
intraoperative period and for 2 hours in the recovery room. Patients' data including age, ASA status, prostate
size, intravenous and irrigating fluid volumes used were recorded. Also, doses of hyperbaric bupivacaine and
opioid used, as well as complications of anaesthesia were obtained. Data analysis was done using SPSS version
16. Transurethral Resection of the Prostate under spinal anaesthesia was performed on six patients. Four
patients received a combination of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 25mcg of fentanyl, while two patients
received bupivacaine plus 0.1 or 0.2mg of morphine. Intraoperatively, shivering occurred in all patients
(100%), while bradycardia was observed in 3 patients(50%). Hypotension, pain and nausea/vomiting were
observed in one patient only. Postoperatively, shivering and bradycardia were observed in 3 and 2 patients
respectively. All complications were successfully treated. Spinal anaesthesia is adequate for TURP, however,
shivering and bradycardia induced by hypothermia are common.

The delivery of a foetus with breech presentation at term is often associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. The optimal mode of delivery to reduce these known complications for breech deliveries at term remains controversial. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and perinatal outcome of singleton breech deliveries at term, and ascertain any association with mode of delivery. This was a retrospective analysis of all singleton term breech presentations delivered in the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital between January 2008 and December 2010. There were 190 singleton breech deliveries out of a total 5007 deliveries during the period giving a prevalence of 3.79%. One hundred and fifty-six (82.1%) were booked while 34(17.9%) were unbooked patients. Ninety-eight (51.6%) of the patients had assisted breech delivery while 27.4% and 21.1% of the patients had elective and emergency Caesarean sections respectively. One hundred and forty-two (74.7%) of the babies had Apgar scores of 7 and above at 5minutes while 24(12.6%) had Apgar scores of 1 to 6 at 5minutes. Elective Caesarean section was associated with Apgar scores of 7 and above 2 at 5 minutes compared to assisted breech delivery and emergency Caesarean section (X = 30.66, P < 0.001). Elective Caesarean section offers a better result for foetuses with breech presentation at term and can be recommended when perinatal outcome is the primary concern.

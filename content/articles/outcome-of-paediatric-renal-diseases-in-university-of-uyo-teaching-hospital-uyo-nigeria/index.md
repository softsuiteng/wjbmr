Paediatric renal diseases constitute a very important non-communicable disease entity with high mortality or long term sequelae in survivors. End Stage Renal Disease is usually the end of the spectrum and its management is out of the financial reach of many Nigerians. Care of the chronically ill child has far-reaching effects on the family. It is essential to describe the outcome of this disease entity in our community so as to know what interventions could improve it. The objective was to determine the response to treatment of various childhood renal diseases in terms of number of discharges, follow-up or mortalities. A prospective study of consecutive children aged 17years and younger admitted with renal diseases at the paediatric nephrology unit of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, from January 2003 to December 2012. Information entered into the renal register included the patients biodata, clinical findings, results of investigations, diagnoses, treatment modalities and outcome of management. The data was analysed using SPSS version 17. Renal diseases constituted 3.1% of the 5,275 paediatric admissions over the study period. Overall mortality rate was 11.7%. Nephrotic syndrome was the most prevalent diagnosis and contributed the largest mortality (52.6%) mainly from complications of CKD, followed by Acute Kidney Injury (26.3%). Atotal of 38.5% of the patients were discharged against medical advice due predominantly to financial constraints. The mortality rate was high, and financial constraints necessitated many discharges against medical advice. We recommend Government's support for renal replacement therapy for children

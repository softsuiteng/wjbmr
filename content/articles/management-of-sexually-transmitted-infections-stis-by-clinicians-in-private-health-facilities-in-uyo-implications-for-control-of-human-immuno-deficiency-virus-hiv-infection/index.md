There's ample evidence that other sexually transmitted infections, whether ulcerative or non-ulcerative, promote HIV transmission by increasing HIV infectivity and susceptibility through several mechanisms, mostly via direct biological pathway. Observational studies have revealed risk estimates of not less than 2, but more importantly, community level intervention studies have proven that timely provision of high quality STI services can significantly reduce HIVincidence. Health seeking behaviour of STI patients among the populace showed a preference for private health facilities, hence the conception of this study which aimed at assessing the pattern of management of STIs by Clinicians in Private Clinics in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. It was a cross-sectional descriptive survey of clinicians in private clinics located in Uyo metropolis, using a structured self-administered questionnaire to collect the data. Twenty-three clinicians participated in the study, 20 males and 3 females. Majority (82.6%) diagnosed STIs using history, clinical and laboratory findings, 73.9% were aware of the existence of the algorithm for managing STIs, but only 47.8% used the algorithm consistently. Although 81.8% of the respondents admitted to offering their patients HIV Counselling and Testing; and 78.3% gave patient education and counselling, only 21.7% gave the correct and complete counselling details. It was concluded that most clinicians in Uyo do not manage STIs effectively, as complete patient education and counselling, a very important component of STI management is not offered by most them. This calls for skills reinforcement in STI management for clinicians in Uyo and Akwa Ibom State.

The influence of Malus domestica (apple fruits) and Moringa oleifera (Moringa seeds) on the activities of
thyroid hormones, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and some antioxidant and organ enzymes in female wistar rats fed
with Manihot esculenta (cassava)-based diets were investigated. Twenty four (24) animals were divided into 3
equal groups (with sub groups a and b). Group1a and 1b (Negative control) received standard diet for 14 and 28
days respectively, Group 2a and 2b (positive control) received cassava cyanide diet for 14 and 28 days
respectively, while group 3a and 3b (treatment group) received apple and moringa preparations respectively
for 14 days, following a 14-day cassava-cyanide diet. The animals were sacrificed and blood samples collected
-1 for hormonal and enzyme assay, using standard methods. Results showed that TPO activities(µL )3.63±0.08,
and 3.52 ± 0.07of rats fed with apple and moringa diets were statistically higher (p<0.05) than the positive
control group 2.64±0.07. There was no significant difference between activities of TPO in the two treatment
diets (p > 0.05). The absence of significant difference between levels of thyroid hormones in the treatment and
negative control rats on one hand and the positive correlation obtained between the glandular weight and feed
type in each of the groups (p < 0.05) on the other hand, supported the ameliorative roles of the plant agents. In
vitro antioxidant capacity of the plant agents followed the decreasing order, Duchess>Golden delicious

moringa treatment group (3b) were higher than in the apple-treatment group (p < 0.05). No significant
difference was found between the former and the negative control (1a) (p >0.05). The moringa diet was more
effective than the apple diet in liver toxicity management. Although the ratios of ALT/AST (De Ritis ratio)
obtained were all below unitary (0.63- 0.8) - confirming the presence of hepatocellular injuries. Serum
pancreatic amylase activity of the positive control rats administered cassava-based diet (group 2b) was
statistically higher (p < 0.05) than those of the other groups. These results confirm the toxicity effects of
cassava-cyanide on the thyroid gland and other organs and the ameliorative roles of the plant agents
introduced .

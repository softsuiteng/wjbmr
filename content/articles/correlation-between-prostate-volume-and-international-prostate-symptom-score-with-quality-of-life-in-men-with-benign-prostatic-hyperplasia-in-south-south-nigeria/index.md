Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a disease of the ageing male. Clinically, patients present with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) which are usually both storage and voiding secondary to bladder outlet obstruction. International prostate symptom score (IPSS) is used to asses symptom severity and the need for treatment. Prostate volume on the other hand, though important in evaluating the patient does not predict symptom severity. This study aimed to determine the correlation between prostate volume and IPPS with Quality of Life (Qol)in patients diagnosed with symptomatic BPH. This was a prospective study involving eighty nine patients aged 43 to 84 years seen at the
Urology clinic between January to December 2018 in whom a detailed history, physical examination and transrectal ultrasound scan of the prostate was performed. The mean age of the patients was 64.02 ±9.60 years while the mean prostate volume was 64.94±42.95mls, mean IPSS was 14.47±5.28 and mean Qol was 4.55 ± 0.97. Correlation between prostate volume and IPSS was weak though statistically significant, no correlation was found between prostate volume and Qol. Prostate volume demonstrated a weak correlation with IPSS while there was no correlation with quality of life scale.

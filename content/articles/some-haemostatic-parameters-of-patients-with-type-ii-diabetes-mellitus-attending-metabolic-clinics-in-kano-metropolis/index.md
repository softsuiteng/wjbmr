Diabetes mellitus (DM) is defined as a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose 
level, resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. It is accompanied by 
biochemical alterations in carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism. Haemostasis is the body's 
normal physiological response to thwart haemorrhagic tendencies and consequently, maintain blood 
fluidity and blood vessel integrity. Abnormalities in haemostasis can result in bleeding (haemorrhage) 
or blood clots (thrombosis). The study aimed to determine some haemostatic parameters in type II 
diabetes patients in Kano Metropolis. One hundred (100) participants enrolled between August 
through November 2019; fifty (50) participants each from diabetic and healthy control subjects were 
recruited for the study. Routine coagulation studies were carried out using conventional methods. The 
prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times (PT and APTT) were statistically significant 
(p<0.05) compared to controls. Astatistically significant positive correlation (p<0.05) between PT and 
APTT in type II diabetic subjects was observed. Decreased PT and APTT values are consistent with 
abnormal coagulation mechanisms, and this may have clinical implications leading to
hypercoagulable state and thrombosis which results in cardiovascular disorders.

His viral load at initial assessment was 6300 copies/ml with a CD4 count of 287cells/ÂµL. Renal ultrasound showed reduced renal sizes with loss of corticomedullary differentiation. He also had proteinuria and haematuria. He had a successful renal transplant after 6 months on haemodialysis using an AVfistula as vascular access and developed New Onset Diabetes after transplant (NODAT).

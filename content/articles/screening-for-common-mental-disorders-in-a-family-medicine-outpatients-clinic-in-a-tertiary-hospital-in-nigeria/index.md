A considerable number of patients seen in the Primary Care Clinics have co-morbid mental disorders that are largely not recognized by the primary care physician. This inability to recognize these mental disorders leads to non-diagnosis and non-treatment resulting in amplification of physical symptoms, low productivity at work and functional disability at home. The objective of this study was to screen the patients attending the general outpatient clinic for co-morbid anxiety and depression. Two hundred and forty five patients aged 20 years and above attending the General Outpatient Clinic of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital were randomly assessed for anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The level of caseness for anxiety and depression were determined using a HADS score of 8 and above. A total of 36.7% of patients scored above cut off point of 8 and above on the anxiety subscale while 24.5% of the subjects scored above cut off point of 8 and above on the depression subscale. A total of65.6% scored 8-10 on the anxiety subscale of HADS which is interpreted to be mild anxiety, 30.0% scored 11-14 on the anxiety subscale of HADS which is interpreted to be moderate anxiety and 4.4% scored 15-21 on the anxiety subscale of HADS which is interpreted to be severe anxiety. Similarly, 65.0% scored 8-10 on the depression subscale of HADS which is interpreted to be mild depression, 31.7% scored 11-14 on the depression subscale of HADS which is interpreted to he moderate depression and 3.3% scored 15-21 on the depression subscale of HADS which is interpreted to be severe depression. The results of the study show that some patients attending general outpatients' clinic also suffer from mental disorders like anxiety and depression. Therefore, a careful assessment of patients attending these clinics using HADS will detect these disorders and treatment will improve the physical condition of the patients.

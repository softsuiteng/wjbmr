Nuclear Medicine (NM) is a newly emerging branch of Medicine in Nigeria that entails the use of radioisotopes
and radiolabelled compounds in diagnosing and treating disease. Ethics may be defined as “the study of
morality careful and systematic reflection on and analysis of moral decisions and behaviour, whether past,
present or future.” The article seeks to review ethical scenarios encountered in the practice of NM. Issues of
medical ethics peculiar to NM are presented in a bid to educate the NM physician, non-NM medical personnel
as well as the general public. Examples are justification and beneficence of NM procedures, adequacy of
informed consent, need for contraception even in infertile patients, care of the radioactive NM patient, and
radioactive waste disposal. Ethical solutions are also proffered.

Colonic diverticulosis refers to blow-outs or herniations of mucosa and submucosa which occur through the
points of weakness of the colon. It occurs commonly in humans living in the western world. It is rare in rural
Africa and Asia. We reviewed cases of colonic diverticulosis seen at general surgery unit of University of Uyo
Teaching Hospital from July, 2008 to June, 2016. This was a hospital based retrospective study designed to
analyze the presentation, management and outcome of adult patients found with colonic diverticulosis over the
eight year period. The patients' records were retrieved and descriptive analysis of the data done. Ten patients
with colonic diverticular disease presented during the eight-year period. The age range was 48 to 85 years, with
a mean age of 66 years. There were 7 males and 3 females giving a male to female ratio of 2.3:1. The average
body mass index (BMI) was 29.5kg/mÂ². Eight patients (80%) had resided in North America and Europe
between 1 to 20 years. Eight (80%) had tertiary education. The average frequency of bowel movement was once
daily. Three patients (30%) were incidentally discovered during colonoscopy while 7 (70%) presented as
emergencies with massive haematochezia. The average duration of hospital admission was 10 days. One
patient died giving a mortality rate of 10%. The commonest mode of presentation of colonic diverticular disease
in UUTH, Uyo is massive lower gastro-intestinal bleeding, which is life threatening. Further, extensive study is
needed to confirm this. We advocate routine colonoscopy for patients over 50 years for early diagnosis and early
treatment.

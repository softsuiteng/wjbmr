Uveitic cataract surgery is usually marred with complications. Complications could be due to persistent
inflammation, ocular structural changes, poor decision on intraocular lens (IOL) implantation and other
ocular comorbidities. This study aims to report immediate and long term outcomes of uveitic cataract surgeries
with and without IOL in Port Harcourt. We reported 3 cases of uveitic cataract surgeries. All the patients had
three months period of treatment for uveitis until inflammatory quiescence was achieved. Two of the cases had
good immediate post-op visual outcome which subsequently degenerated over time with pthisis bulbi. The third
patient was left aphakic and he is the only one without recurrence of uveitis after surgery. He is planned for
contact lens. Follow up for patient who have had uveitic cataract surgery should be prolonged with close
monitoring of the steroid and immune suppressant therapies. This is because good outcome could be achieved
in immediate post-operative period but recurrence could mar long term outcome especially following wrong
patient selection and timing with regards to IOL implantation.
